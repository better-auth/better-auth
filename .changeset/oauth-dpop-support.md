feat(oauth-provider)!: DPoP-bound access tokens (RFC 9449)

OAuth provider integrations can issue and verify DPoP sender-constrained tokens. Clients request them with `dpop_bound_access_tokens` at registration, `dpop_jkt` on the authorization request, or by targeting a resource configured with `dpopBoundAccessTokensRequired`. Issued tokens carry `cnf.jkt`, return `token_type: "DPoP"`, and stay bound through refresh-token rotation, introspection, and userinfo.

Resource servers verify DPoP requests with `verifyAccessTokenRequest`, which checks the `Authorization: DPoP` scheme, the proof, the request target, the access-token hash, and proof replay. The MCP package advertises DPoP in protected resource metadata and verifies DPoP-bound requests. Proof replay is rejected through the database-backed verification store, so anti-replay holds across instances. `verifyAccessTokenRequest` and `requireMcpAuth` use that store by default; build one with `createDpopReplayStore(internalAdapter)` or pass a custom `dpop.replayStore`. This needs database-backed verification storage: a secondary-storage-only deployment rejects DPoP requests rather than skipping replay protection.

Breaking: the raw-token verifier `verifyAccessToken` is renamed to `verifyBearerToken`, both in `better-auth/oauth2` and as the `oauthProviderResourceClient` action, and it rejects DPoP-bound tokens. Use `verifyAccessTokenRequest` on any endpoint that may receive them. The resource-request input type is renamed from `AccessTokenRequestInput` to `ResourceRequestInput`, and the DPoP algorithm option is `signingAlgorithms` everywhere.

Run a schema migration for the DPoP token-binding fields: the `confirmation` column on the access-token and refresh-token tables. DPoP-bound clients also gain `dpopBoundAccessTokens` and resources `dpopBoundAccessTokensRequired`. No dedicated replay table is added; proof replay reuses the verification store.
