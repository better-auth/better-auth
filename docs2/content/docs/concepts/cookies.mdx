description: Learn how cookies are used in Better Auth.
---

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, OAuth state, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

### Cookie Prefix

Better Auth cookies will follow `${prefix}.${cookie_name}` format by default. The prefix will be "better-auth" by default. You can change the prefix by setting `cookiePrefix` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookiePrefix: "my-app"
    }
})
```

### Custom Cookies

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode.

If you want to set custom cookie names and attributes, you can do so by setting `cookieOptions` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

By default, Better Auth uses the following cookies:

- `session_token` to store the session token
- `session_data` to store the session data if cookie cache is enabled
- `dont_remember` to store the `dont_remember` flag if remember me is disabled

Plugins may also use cookies to store data. For example, the Two Factor Authentication plugin uses the `two_factor` cookie to store the two-factor authentication state.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookies: {
            session_token: {
                name: "custom_session_token",
                attributes: {
                    // Set custom cookie attributes
                }
            },
        }
    }
})
```

### Cross Subdomain Cookies

Sometimes you may need to share cookies across subdomains. For example, if you have `app.example.com` and `example.com`, and if you authenticate on `example.com`, you may want to access the same session on `app.example.com`.

By default, cookies are not shared between subdomains. However, if you need to access the same session across different subdomains, you can enable cross-subdomain cookies by configuring `crossSubDomainCookies` and `defaultCookieAttributes` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

<Callout>The leading period of the `domain` attribute broadens the cookie's scope beyond your main domain, making it accessible across all subdomains.</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: ".example.com", // Domain with a leading period
        },
        defaultCookieAttributes: {
            secure: true,
            httpOnly: true,
            sameSite: "none",  // Allows CORS-based cookie sharing across subdomains
            partitioned: true, // New browser standards will mandate this for foreign cookies
        },
    },
    trustedOrigins: [
        'https://example.com',
        'https://app1.example.com',
        'https://app2.example.com',
    ],
})
```

<Callout type="warn">Setting your `sameSite` cookie attribute to `none` makes you vulnerable to CSRF attacks. To mitigate risks, configure `trustedOrigins` with an array of authorized origins to allow.</Callout>

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure only when the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be always secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```
