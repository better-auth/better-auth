Here are non detailed reasons why you may want to use Better Auth over other auth libraries and services.

### vs Other Auth Libraries

- You need more features from your auth library.
- We support almost all frameworks out of the box.
- You need advanced features like two-factor authentication, multi-tenancy, multi-session, admin tools, rate limiting, etc.
- You want to have more control over your auth flow.
- You prefer more comprehensive documentation.
- You like the idea of a plugin system to extend the library.
- You want to use a library that is actively maintained and has a growing community.

### vs Self Hosted Auth Server
- You want to keep your users in your main database (the same database as your app).
- You need more control over your auth flow.
- You don't want the hassle of self-hosting your auth server.
- And there's a high possibility that we already cover the features you need. Additionally, you can always extend it using our plugin system.

### vs Managed Auth Services (Paid)

- You don't want to give up user data to a third party.
- You want a single source of truth for your users.
- You don't want to pay for every user.
- You want to keep your users in your own database (the same database as your app).

### vs Roll Your Own Auth

- You don't want to maintain a lot of code that isn't your core business.
- You want to delegate the security to a community of people who probably care more than you do.
- We probably cover most of the features you'll need, and you can always extend it using our plugin system.
