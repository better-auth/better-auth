### vs Other Auth Libraries

- We probably support the framework you are using.
- You need more featuers from your auth library.
- You need advanced features like two-factor authentication, multi-tenancy, multi-session, admin tools, rate limiting, etc.
- You want to have more control over your auth flow.
- You prefer more comprehensive documentation.

### vs Self Hosted Auth Server
- You want to keep your users on your own database (the same database as your app).
- You need more control over your auth flow.
- You don't want the hassle of self-hosting your auth server.
- And there is a high possibilty that we cover more features you need. And you can alway extends it using our plugin system.

### vs Managed Auth Services (paid)

- You don’t want to give up user data to a third party.
- You want a single source of truth for your users.
- You prefer not to pay for authentication.
- You want to keep your users on your own database (the same database as your app).

### vs Roll Your Own Auth

- You don’t want to maintain a lot of code that isn’t your core business.
- You want to deligate the security to a community of people who probably care more than you do.
- We probably cover most of the features you need, and you can always extend it using our plugin system.
