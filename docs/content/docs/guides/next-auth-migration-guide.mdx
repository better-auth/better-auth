title: Migrating from NextAuth to BetterAuth
description: A step-by-step guide to getting started with BetterAuth.
---

In this guide, we’ll explore how to seamlessly transition a project from Next Auth to Better Auth while ensuring that no data or functionality is lost. This guide assumes you’re using Next.js as your framework, but it should be applicable to other frameworks as well.

## Before we get started

 Before we start the migration process, we need to setup BetterAuth in our project. You can use the [installation guide](/docs/guides/installation) to get started.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Mapping Existing Columns
        
        Rather than replacing existing column names in your database, you can map them to Better Auth’s expected structure. This way, you can maintain your existing database schema. 


        #### User Schema

        Next Auth default uesr schema is the same as what is expected by Better Auth so there shouldn't be any problem there.

        #### Session Schema

        We need to map 2 fields in the session schema:

        - expires to expiresAt
        - sessionToken to token
        
        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            //...Other configs
            session: {
                fields: {
                    expiresAt: "expires", // or "expires_at" or whatever your existing field is
                    token: "sessionToken" // or "session_token" or whatever your existing field is
                }
            },
        });
        ```

        ### Accounts Schema

        We need to map some fields in the accounts schema. 

        - providerAccountId to accountId
        - refersh_token to refreshToken
        - access_token to accessToken
        - access_token_expires to accessTokenExpiresAt
        - id_token to idToken

        and you can remove "session_state", "type" and "token_type" fields as they are not needed by Better Auth.


        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            // Other configs
            accounts: {
                fields: {
                    accountId: "providerAccountId",
                    refreshToken: "refresh_token",
                    accessToken: "access_token",
                    accessTokenExpiresAt: "access_token_expires",
                    idToken: "id_token",
                }
            },
        });
        ```

        **NOTE:** If you're using orm adapters, you can also map the fields in your schema file

        **Example with Prisma**
        ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
        model Session {
            id          String   @id @default(cuid())
            expires     DateTime @map("expiresAt") // Map expires to your existing expires field // [!code highlight]
            token       String   @map("sessionToken") // Map token to your existing sessionToken field // [!code highlight]
            userId      String
            user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Change Route Handler

        If you haven't noticed this in the installation guide, navigate to the `app/api/auth` folder and rename the `[...nextauth]` file to `[...all]` to avoid confusion. Inside the `route.ts` file, add the following code:

        ```typescript title="app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts"       
        import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";
        import { auth } from "~/server/auth";

        export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Client

        Next, create a file named `auth-client.ts` in the `lib` folder. Add the following code to the file:

        ```typescript
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL! // Your API base URL (optional if it's the same as the frontend)
        })
        export const { signIn, signOut, useSession } = authClient;
        ```

        ### Add your social login functions

        change your signIn functions from NextAuth to Better Auth. Here is an example of how to do that for discord:

        ```typescript
        import { signIn } from "~/lib/auth-client"

        export const signInDiscord = async () => {
            const data = await signIn.social({
                provider: "discord"
            })
            return data
        }
        ```

        ### Change `useSession` calls

        Change your `useSession` calls from NextAuth to Better Auth. Here is an example of how to do that:

        ```tsx title="Profile.tsx"
        import { useSession } from "~/lib/auth-client"

        export const Profile = () => {
            const { data } = useSession()
            return (
                <div>
                    <pre>
                        {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
                    </pre>
                </div>
            )
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
     ### Get Server Session

     To get session data on the server, you can use the auth instance you created in the `auth.ts` file. Here is an example of how to do that:

     ```typescript title="actions.ts"
     "use server";

    import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";
    import { headers } from "next/headers";

    export const protectedAction = ()=>{
        const session = auth.api.getSession({
            headers: await headers();
        })
    }
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Middleware 

    To protect routes with middleware see [next middleware guide](/docs/integrations/next#middleware).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Wrapping up

Congratulations! You’ve successfully migrated from NextAuth to BetterAuth. If you'd like to see a more complete code or a live demo, check out the full implementation with multiple auth added [here](https://github.com/Bekacru/t3-app-better-auth).

Better Auth provides a lot more features and flexibility, so be sure to explore our docs to see what else you can do with it.
