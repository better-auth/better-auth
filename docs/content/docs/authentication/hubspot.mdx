    <Step>
        ### Get your HubSpot Credentials
        1. Log into your HubSpot account
        2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Private Apps** (or **Settings > Integrations > Connected Apps** for OAuth apps)
        3. Click **Create a private app** or **Create an app** (depending on your HubSpot account type)
        4. Fill in the basic information:
           - App Name: Your app name
           - Description: Brief description of your application
           - Contact Email: Your email address
        5. Configure OAuth Settings:
           - Enable **OAuth** or **OAuth 2.0** settings
           - Set **Redirect URL** to your redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/hubspot` for development)
           - Select Required OAuth Scopes:
             - `oauth` (required - basic OAuth scope)
             - Additional scopes as needed for your application (e.g., `contacts`, `content`, `reports`)
        6. Enable **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** (required)
        7. Save and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

    <Callout type="info">
        - For development, you can use `http://localhost:3000` URLs, but production requires HTTPS
        - The callback URL must exactly match what's configured in Better Auth
        - PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is required by HubSpot and is automatically handled by the provider
        - The `oauth` scope is automatically included by the provider
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning">
        Make sure to configure the correct redirect URI in your HubSpot app settings. The redirect URI must match exactly, including the protocol, domain, and path.
    </Callout>

    </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Configure the provider
    To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            hubspot: { // [!code highlight]
                clientId: process.env.HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                clientSecret: process.env.HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        },
    })
    ```

    #### Configuration Options

    - `clientId`: Your HubSpot app's Client ID
    - `clientSecret`: Your HubSpot app's Client Secret
    - `scope`: Additional scopes to request (the `oauth` scope is included by default)

    #### Advanced Configuration

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            hubspot: {
                clientId: process.env.HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID as string,
                clientSecret: process.env.HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
                scope: ["contacts", "content"], // Additional scopes // [!code highlight]
            },
        },
    })
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
        - The `oauth` scope is automatically included and is required for basic OAuth functionality
        - You can add additional scopes based on your application's needs
    </Callout>
    </Step>

   <Step>
    ### Environment Variables
    Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

    ```bash title=".env.local"
    HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
    HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Important for redirect URI generation
    ```

    For production:
    ```bash title=".env"
    HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
    HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Sign In with HubSpot
    To sign in with HubSpot, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
    - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `hubspot`.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    const authClient = createAuthClient()

    const signIn = async () => {
        const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "hubspot"
        })
    }
    ```
</Step>
<Step>
    ### Troubleshooting

    #### PKCE Requirements
    HubSpot requires PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) which is automatically handled by this provider. Make sure PKCE is enabled in your HubSpot app settings.

    #### Scope Issues
    If you're getting insufficient permissions errors:
    - Verify that the required scopes are enabled in your HubSpot app settings
    - The `oauth` scope is required and is automatically included
    - Add additional scopes in the provider configuration if needed

    <Callout type="info">
        The default scope requested is `oauth`. You can add additional scopes based on your application's requirements. The provider will automatically include the `oauth` scope for basic OAuth functionality.
    </Callout>
