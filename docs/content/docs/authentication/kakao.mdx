<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Kakao Credentials
        To use Kakao sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Kakao Developer Portal](https://developers.kakao.com).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/kakao` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        <Callout type="warn">
          Kakao login requests `account_email` scope by default. However, retrieving an email address is only possible if your app is switched to **Biz App** status in the Kakao Developers Console.

          If you are using a Test App or have not switched to Biz App yet, you will encounter an "Invalid Scope" error. To resolve this, you must set `disableDefaultScope: true` and manually specify the allowed scopes (e.g., `profile_nickname`, `profile_image`).
        </Callout>

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                kakao: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.KAKAO_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                    // If your app is not a Biz App, you must disable the default scope
                    // disableDefaultScope: true,
                    // scope: ["profile_nickname", "profile_image"]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            }
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Sign In with Kakao
        To sign in with Kakao, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `kakao`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "kakao"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
