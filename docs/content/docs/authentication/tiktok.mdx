    <Step>
        ### Get your TikTok Credentials
        Get your TikTok credentials from the [TikTok Developer](https://developers.tiktok.com/).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/tiktok` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

        <Callout type="info">
            The TikTok API does not provide email addresses. As a workaround, the user's `email` field uses the `preferred_username` value instead.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                tiktok: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with TikTok
        To sign in with TikTok, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `tiktok`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "tiktok"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
