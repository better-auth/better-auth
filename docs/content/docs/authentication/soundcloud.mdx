description: SoundCloud provider setup and usage.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Get your SoundCloud credentials
        To use SoundCloud sign-in, you need a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.   
        SoundCloud currently does not give self-service access to their API. You need to contact them via their [SoundCloud Support - ChatBot](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

        After support has created the app for you, copy the following values from the app's [dashboard](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps):
        - **Client ID** → `clientId`
        - **Client Secret** → `clientSecret`

         
        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/soundcloud` for local development.  
        In production, it should be `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/soundcloud` (or similar if you changed the base auth path).
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        Import the provider and pass it into the `socialProviders` option of your auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
          socialProviders: {
            soundcloud: { // [!code highlight]
              clientId: process.env.SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
              clientSecret: process.env.SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
          },
        })
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
            - The SoundCloud API does not provide email addresses, therefore the `email` field is always null.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Sign In with SoundCloud
        Use the `signIn.social` helper from the client:

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient = createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
          const { data, error } = await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "soundcloud",
          })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
    SoundCloud does **not** provide granular scopes – once the user authorises your application you receive a token that is allowed to perform all actions permitted for third-party apps (upload, like, follow, etc.).  
    Therefore the `scope` option in the provider configuration is ignored.
