    <Step> 
        ### Get your Twitter Credentials
        Get your Twitter credentials from the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitter` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"  
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth" 
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                twitter: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_ID, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Twitter 
        To sign in with Twitter, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `twitter`.

        ```ts title="client.ts"  
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const client = createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await client.signIn.social({
                provider: "twitter"
            })
        }
        ```
        <Callout type="warn">
            If twitter doesn't return the email address, the authentication won't be successful. Make sure to ask for the email address when you create the Twitter app.
        </Callout>
