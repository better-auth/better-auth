<Steps>
  <Step> 
    ### Create a Zoom App from Marketplace
    1. Visit [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us).

    1. Hover on the `Develop` button and select `Build App`

    1. Select `General App` and click `Create`

  </Step>

  <Step> 
    ### Configure your Zoom App
    
    Ensure that you are in the `Basic Information` of your app settings.

    1. Under `Select how the app is managed`, choose `User-managed`

    1. Under `App Credentials`, copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and store them in a safe location

    1. Under `OAuth Information` -> `OAuth Redirect URL`, add your Callback URL. For example,

       ```
       http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/zoom
       ```

       <Callout>
       For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base
       path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
       </Callout>

    Skip to the `Scopes` section, then
    1. Click the `Add Scopes` button
    1. Search for `user:read:user` (View a user) and select it
    1. Add any other scopes your applications needs and click `Done`

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure the provider
    To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
      socialProviders: {
        zoom: { // [!code highlight]
          clientId: process.env.ZOOM_CLIENT_ID, // [!code highlight]
          clientSecret: process.env.ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET, // [!code highlight]
        }, // [!code highlight]
      },
    })
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Sign In with Zoom 
    To sign in with Zoom, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client.
    You will need to specify `salesforce` as the provider.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    const authClient =  createAuthClient()

    const signIn = async () => {
      const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
        provider: "zoom"
      })
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
