description: Implementing email and password authentication with Better Auth
---

Email and password authentication is a common method used by many applications. Better Auth provides a built-in email and password authenticator that you can easily integrate into your project.

<Callout type="info">
  If you prefer username-based authentication, check out the <Link href="/docs/plugins/username">username plugin</Link>. It extends the email and password authenticator with username support.
</Callout>

## Enable Email and Password

To enable email and password authentication, you need to set the `emailAndPassword.enabled` option to `true` in the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
If it's not enabled, it'll not allow you to sign in or sign up with email and password.
</Callout>


## Usage

### Signup

To signup a user, you can use the `signUp.email` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 32 by default.
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user. (optional)
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed up. (optional)
- `dontRememberMe`: If true, the user will be signed out when the browser session is closed. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts"
const signup = async () => {
    const data = await client.signUp.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        name: "test",
        image: "https://example.com/image.png",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

### Signin

To signin a user, you can use the `signIn.email` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed in. (optional)
- `dontRememberMe`: If true, the user will be signed out when the browser is closed. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signin = async () => {
    const data = await client.signIn.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

### Email Verification

To enable email verification, you need to provider `sendVerificationEmail` function to the email and password authenticator. The `sendVerificationEmail` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `url`: The url to send to the user which contains the token.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
        enabled: true,
        async sendVerificationEmail(email, url){
            // send email to user.
        }
    }
})
```

on the client side you can use `sendVerificationEmail` function to send verification link to user. This will trigger the `sendVerificationEmail` function you provided in the `auth` configuration.

Once the user clicks on the link in the email, if the token is valid, the user will be redirected to the URL provided in the `callbackURL` parameter. If the token is invalid, the user will be redirected to the URL provided in the `callbackURL` parameter with an error message in the query string `?error=invalid_token`.


### Forget Password

to allow users to reset a password first you need to provider `sendResetPassword` function to the email and password authenticator. The `sendResetPassword` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `user`: The user object.
- `url`: The url to send to the user which contains the token.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
        async sendResetPassword(url, user) { // [!code highlight]
            // send email to user  // [!code highlight]
            await sendResetEmail(user.email, url) //your function to send email to user // [!code highlight]
        }, // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

once you configured your server you can call `forgetPassword` function to send reset password link to user. If the user exists, it will trigger the `sendResetPassword` function you provided in` the `auth` configuration.

It takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `redirectTo`: The URL to redirect to after the user clicks on the link in the email. If the token is valid, the user will be redirected to this URL with the token in the query string. If the token is invalid, the user will be redirected to this URL with an error message in the query string `?error=invalid_token`.

```ts title="client.ts"
const forgetPassword = async () => {
    const data = await client.forgetPassword({
        email: "test@example.com",
        redirectTo: "/reset-password"
    })
}
```

When user click on the link in the email he will be redirected to the reset password page. You can add the reset password page to your app. Then you can use `resetPassword` function to reset the password. It takes an object with the following properties:

- `newPassword`: The new password of the user.

```ts title="client.ts"
const data = await client.resetPassword({
    newPassword: "password1234",
})
```

### Configuration

**Password**

Better Auth stores passwords inside the `account` table with `providerId` set to `credential`.

**Password Hashing**: Better Auth uses `scrypt` to hash passwords. The `scrypt` algorithm is designed to be slow and memory-intensive to make it difficult for attackers to brute force passwords.  OWSAP recommends using `scrypt  if `argon2id` is not available. We decided to use `scrypt` because it's natively supported by Node.js.

You can pass custom password hashing algothim by setting `passwordHasher` option in the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { scrypt } from "scrypt"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...rest of the options
    emailAndPassword: {
        password: {
            hash: // your custom password hashing function
            verify: // your custom password verification function
        }
    }
})
```
