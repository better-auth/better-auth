description: Implementing email and password authentication with Better Auth
---

Email and password authentication is a common method used by many applications. Better Auth provides a built-in email and password authenticator that you can easily integrate into your project.

<Callout type="info">
  If you prefer username-based authentication, check out the <Link href="/docs/plugins/username">username plugin</Link>. It extends the email and password authenticator with username support.
</Callout>

## Setup

To enable email and password authentication, add the following configuration to your Better Auth instance:

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash 
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite",
    },
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
If it's not enabled, it'll not allow you to sign in or sign up with email and password.
</Callout>


## Usage

### Signup

To signup a user, you can use the `signUp.email` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 32 by default. 
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user. (optional)
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed up. (optional)
- `dontRememberMe`: If true, the user will be signed out when the browser is closed. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash /
/**
 * Make sure to import the client for your framework
 */
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signup = async () => {
    const data = await client.signUp.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        name: "test",
        image: "https://example.com/image.png",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

The function returns a promise that resolves an object with `data` and `error` properties. The `data` property contains the user object that was created, and the `error` property contains any error that occurred during the signup process.

<Callout type="info">
Hover over the `data` object to see the shape of the response.
</Callout>

### Signin

To signin a user, you can use the `signIn.email` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed in. (optional)
- `dontRememberMe`: If true, the user will be signed out when the browser is closed. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signin = async () => {
    const data = await client.signIn.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

### Email Verification

To enable email verification, you need to configure the email and password authenticator. You can do this by adding the following code to your better auth instance:

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash

import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    // ---cut-start---
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite"
    },
    // ---cut-end---
    emailAndPassword: {    
        enabled: true, 
        async sendVerificationEmail(email, url){
            // send email to user.
        }
    }
})
```

on the client side you can use `sendVerificationEmail` function to send verification link to user.

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash  
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const client = createAuthClient()
// ---cut---
const verifyEmail = async () => {
    const data = await client.sendVerificationEmail({
	    email: "test@example.com",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

### Password Reset


to reset a password first you need to provider `sendResetPasswordToken` function to the email and password authenticator. The `sendResetPasswordToken` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `user`: The user object.
- `token`: The token that was generated.

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash 
async function sendResetEmail(email: string, url: string){
    // send email to user
}
// ---cut---
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite",
    },
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
        async sendResetPasswordToken(token, user) { // [!code highlight]
            // send email to user  // [!code highlight]
            const url = `https://example.com/reset-password?token=${token}` // [!code highlight]
            await sendResetEmail(user.email, url) //your function to send email to user // [!code highlight]
        }, // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

once you configured your server you can call `forgetPassword` function to send reset password link to user.

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const client = createAuthClient()
// ---cut---
const forgetPassword = async () => {
    const data = await client.forgetPassword({
        email: "test@example.com",
    })
}
```

When user click on the link in the email he will be redirected to the reset password page. You can add the reset password page to your app. Then you can use `resetPassword` function to reset the password. It takes an object with the following properties:

- `token`: The token that was generated.
- `newPassword`: The new password of the user.

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()
function useSearchParams() {
    return {
        get: (key: string) => "" as string | null,
    }
}
// ---cut---
const token = useSearchParams().get("token") // get token from url
const resetPassword = async () => {
    if(!token) return
    const data = await client.resetPassword({
        token: token,
        newPassword: "password1234",
    })
}
```
