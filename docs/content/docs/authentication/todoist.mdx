<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Todoist credentials
        To use Todoist as a social provider, you need to get your Todoist OAuth credentials. You can get them by adding a new integration in settings [Todoist App Integration Settings](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/app-management).

        In the Todoist app settings, make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/todoist` for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/todoist`. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

        <Callout>
        Make sure your Todoist app has the appropriate scopes configured. For basic user authentication, the `data:read` scope is required to access user profile information.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.todoist` in your auth configuration.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                todoist: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.TODOIST_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Todoist

To sign in with Todoist, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `todoist`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
const authClient = createAuthClient();

const signIn = async () => {
  const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "todoist",
  });
};
```

### Todoist Scopes

Todoist supports various scopes that determine what data your application can access:

- **data:read**: Read-only access to user data (required for authentication)
- **data:read_write**: Read and write access to user data
- **task:add**: Permission to add new tasks
- **data:delete**: Permission to delete user data
- **project:delete**: Permission to delete projects

You can specify additional scopes when configuring the provider:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    todoist: {
      clientId: process.env.TODOIST_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
      scope: ["data:read", "task:add"], // [!code highlight]
    },
  },
});
```

### Requesting Additional Todoist Scopes

If your application needs additional Todoist permissions after the user has already signed up, you can request them using the `linkSocial` method with additional scopes.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const requestTodoistAccess = async () => {
    await authClient.linkSocial({
        provider: "todoist",
        // Additional scopes will be requested during the linking process
    });
};

// Example usage in a React component
return <button onClick={requestTodoistAccess}>Connect Todoist</button>;
```

<Callout>
  After authentication, you can use the access token to interact with the
  Todoist API to manage tasks, projects, and other user data based on the
  granted scopes.
</Callout>
