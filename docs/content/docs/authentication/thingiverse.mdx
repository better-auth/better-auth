<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Get your Credentials
        1. Sign in to your Thingiverse account and go to the [Thingiverse Developer Console](https://www.thingiverse.com/developers/my-apps)
        2. Click "Create an app"
        3. Make sure it's set to be a "Web App"
        4. Fill out the app details
        5. Click "Create & Get app key"
        6. Configure your redirect URI (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/thingiverse`)
        7. Note your Client ID and Client Secret

        Make sure to set the redirect URI to match your application's callback URL. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URI accordingly.
    </Step>

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                thingiverse: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.THINGIVERSE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.THINGIVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Thingiverse
        To sign in with Thingiverse, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `thingiverse`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "thingiverse"
            })
        }
        ```
