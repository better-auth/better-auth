description: Steam provider setup and usage.

<Callout>
Steam authentication is setup differently from other providers, as Steam does not fully comply with OAuth or OIDC standards.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
    ### Get your Steam API Key
    To get your Steam API key, you need to create a new application on the [Steam Developer Portal](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

    Set the domain name to `localhost` for development.

    Note: You may need another API key for production, with the domain name set to the production origin of your application.

    Once you have your API key, add that to your environment variables:

    ```env title=".env"
    STEAM_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Configure the provider
    To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { steam } from "@better-auth/steam"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [
            steam({
                steamApiKey: process.env.STEAM_API_KEY,
            })
        ]
    })
    ```
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Sign in with Steam

    To sign in with Steam, call the `signIn.steam` method.
    
    You will need to pass the email of the user to the `email` option, as Steam does not provide an email address.

    ```ts
    authClient.signIn.steam({
        email: "user@example.com",
        callbackURL: "/dashboard"
    });
    ```
</Step>
