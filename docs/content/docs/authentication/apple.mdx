        ### Get your OAuth credentials
        To use Apple sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list).

        Apple requires a little harder setup to get a client secret. You can use the guide below to get your client secret.

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        const process = {
            env: {
                APPLE_CLIENT_ID: "" as string,
                APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "" as string,
            }
        }
        // ---cut---
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { apple } from "better-auth/social-providers"

        export const auth = await betterAuth({
            socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
                apple({ // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }), // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Signin with Apple
        To signin with Apple, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `apple`.

        ```ts title="client.ts"  /
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const client = createAuthClient()

        const signin = async () => {
            const data = await client.signIn.social({
                provider: "apple"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
