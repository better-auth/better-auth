Enabling OAuth with Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly Active Directory) allows your users to sign in and sign up to your application with their Microsoft account.


<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Microsoft credentials
        To use Microsoft as a social provider, you need to get your Microsoft credentials. Which involves generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Microsoft Entra ID dashboard account.

        see the [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) for more information.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Configure the provider
    To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.microsoft` in your auth configuration.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"   
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
            microsoft: { // [!code highlight]
                clientId: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                clientSecret: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        }, // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Signin with Microsoft

To signin with Microsoft, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `microsoft`.

```ts title="client.ts"  /
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signin = async () => {
    const data = await client.signIn.social({
        provider: "microsoft",
        callbackURL: "/dashboard" //the url to redirect to after the signin
    })
}
```
