        ### Get your Google credentials
        To use Google as a social provider, you need to get your Google credentials. You can get them by creating a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.google` in your auth configuration.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"   
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { google } from "better-auth/social-providers"
        
        export const auth = await betterAuth({
            socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
                google: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

        ### Signin with Google
        To signin with Google, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `google`.

        ```ts title="client.ts"  /
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const client = createAuthClient()
        
        const signin = async () => {
            const data = await client.signIn.social({
                provider: "google"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
