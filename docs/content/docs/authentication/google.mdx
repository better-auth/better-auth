        ### Get your Google credentials
        To use Google as a social provider, you need to get your Google credentials. You can get them by creating a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

        In the Google Cloud Console > Credentials > Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google`. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.google` in your auth configuration.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"   
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                google: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Google

To sign in with Google, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `google`.

```ts title="client.ts"  /
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const client = createAuthClient()

const signIn = async () => {
    const data = await client.signIn.social({
        provider: "google"
    })
}
```

### Sign In with Google With ID Token

To sign in with Google using the ID Token, you can use the `signIn.social` function to pass the ID Token.

This is useful when you have the ID Token from Google on the client-side and want to use it to sign in on the server.

```ts title="client.ts"
const data = await client.signIn.social({
    provider: "google",
    idToken: {
        token: // Google ID Token,
        accessToken: // Google Access Token
    }
})
```
