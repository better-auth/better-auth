    <Step> 
        ### Get your Facebook credentials
        To use Facebook sign in, you need a client ID and client Secret. You can get them from the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).
        Select your app, navigate to **App Settings > Basic**, locate the following:  
        - **App ID**: This is your `clientId`
        - **App Secret**: This is your `clientSecret`.

        <Callout type="warn">
        Avoid exposing the `clientSecret` in client-side code (e.g., frontend apps) because itâ€™s sensitive information.
        </Callout>

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"  
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                facebook: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Facebook 
        To sign in with Facebook, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `facebook`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/auth-client"
        const authClient = createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "facebook"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
