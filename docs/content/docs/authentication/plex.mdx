        ### Get your Plex Client Identifier
        To use Plex sign in, you need a unique client identifier for your application. Unlike traditional OAuth providers, Plex uses PIN-based authentication and doesn't require a client secret.

        You can generate a unique identifier (UUID or random string) for your application. Store this identifier securely as it should remain consistent across your application's lifetime.

        <Callout type="info">
            - Plex uses a PIN-based authentication flow instead of traditional OAuth2
            - No client secret is required
            - The same client identifier should be used consistently for your application
            - For production applications, consider generating a UUID v4 as your client identifier
        </Callout>
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                plex: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.PLEX_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```

        #### Options
        The Plex provider accepts the following options:

        - `clientId`: `string` **(required)** - A unique identifier for your application
        - `product`: `string` - The name of your application/product (default: `"better-auth"`)
        - `version`: `string` - The version of your application (default: `"1.0"`)
        - `platform`: `string` - The platform your application runs on, e.g., "Web", "iOS", "Android" (default: `"Web"`)
        - `device`: `string` - The device name (default: `"Browser"`)

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                plex: {
                    clientId: process.env.PLEX_CLIENT_ID as string,
                    product: "My App",
                    version: "1.0.0",
                    platform: "Web",
                    device: "Browser",
                },
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Plex
        To sign in with Plex, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `plex`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "plex"
            })
        }
        ```

        ### How Plex Authentication Works:
        1. A PIN is generated from the Plex API
        2. User is redirected to Plex's authentication page
        3. User authorizes the application on Plex
        4. Plex redirects back to your application with the PIN
        5. The PIN is exchanged for an access token
        6. User information is fetched from Plex

        <Callout type="info">
            - Plex authentication uses a PIN-based flow, not traditional OAuth2
            - Users must have a Plex account to sign in
            - The authentication flow works with both free and Plex Pass accounts
        </Callout>

        ### Additional Options:
        - `product`: The name of your application/product.
            - Default: `"better-auth"`
        - `version`: The version of your application.
            - Default: `"1.0"`
        - `platform`: The platform your application runs on.
            - Default: `"Web"`
            - Options: `"Web"`, `"iOS"`, `"Android"`, etc.
        - `device`: The device name.
            - Default: `"Browser"`
        - `mapProfileToUser`: Custom function to map Plex profile data to user object.
        - `getUserInfo`: Custom function to retrieve user information.
    </Step>
