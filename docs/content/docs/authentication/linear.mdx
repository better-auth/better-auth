<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Linear OAuth credentials
        
        To use Linear as a social provider, you need to create an OAuth application in your Linear workspace. Follow these steps:

        1. Go to your [Linear workspace settings](https://linear.app/settings)
        2. Navigate to the **"API"** section in the sidebar
        3. Click **"Create new OAuth app"**
        4. Fill in your application details:
           - **Name**: Your application name (e.g., "My App")
           - **Description**: Brief description of your application
           - **Website**: Your application's website URL (optional)
           - **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/linear` (for development)
        5. Click **"Create application"**
        6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application details

        <Callout type="warn">
            For production, make sure to update the callback URL to your production domain: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/linear`. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the callback URL accordingly.
        </Callout>

        <Callout>
            Linear OAuth apps are workspace-specific. Users can only authenticate if they have access to the workspace where the OAuth app was created.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider

        Add Linear to your `betterAuth` configuration and set up your environment variables:

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                linear: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.LINEAR_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```

        Add the environment variables to your `.env` file:

        ```env title=".env"
        LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_linear_client_id
        LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linear_client_secret
        ```

        <Callout type="warn">
            Keep your `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET` secure and never expose it in client-side code. Store it securely in your environment variables.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Sign In with Linear

        Use the Linear provider to authenticate users in your application:

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient = createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "linear" // [!code highlight]
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Available Scopes

Linear supports the following OAuth scopes that determine what data your application can access:

- **`read`** (default): Read access to user profile and workspace data
- **`write`**: Write access to create and modify issues, comments, and other Linear objects
- **`admin`**: Administrative access to workspace settings and user management

### Custom Scopes

You can specify custom scopes by adding them to the provider configuration:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    linear: {
      clientId: process.env.LINEAR_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
      scope: ["read", "write"], // [!code highlight]
    },
  },
});
```

<Callout>
  If no scope is specified, Linear defaults to the `read` scope. Make sure your
  OAuth app has the necessary permissions for the scopes you request.
</Callout>

### User Profile Data

The Linear provider returns the following user information:

**Standard fields:**

- `id`: Linear user's unique identifier
- `name`: User's display name
- `email`: User's email address
- `image`: User's avatar URL
- `emailVerified`: Always `true` for Linear accounts

**Linear-specific data** (available in the `data` object):

- `active`: Whether the user account is active
- `admin`: Whether the user has admin privileges in the workspace
- `timezone`: User's configured timezone
- `guest`: Whether the user is a guest user
- `createdAt`: When the user account was created
- `updatedAt`: When the user account was last updated
