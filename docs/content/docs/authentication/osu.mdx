  <Step> 
    ### Get your osu! credentials
    You can get osu! OAuth credentials by creating a client from your [osu! settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#oauth)

    When configuring the client, make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/osu` during local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/osu`. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure the provider
    To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.osu` in your auth configuration.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"   
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            osu: { // [!code highlight]
                clientId: process.env.OSU_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                clientSecret: process.env.OSU_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        },
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with osu!

To sign in with osu!, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `osu`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const authClient =  createAuthClient()

const signIn = async () => {
    const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
        provider: "osu"
    })
}
```
