        ### Get your Vercel credentials
        To use Vercel sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/integrations).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/vercel` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                vercel: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.VERCEL_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.VERCEL_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Vercel
        To sign in with Vercel, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `vercel`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "vercel"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Setting up your Vercel Integration

Vercel supports OAuth integrations for both personal accounts and teams.

To create an integration:

1. Go to your [Vercel Integrations Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/integrations)
2. Click "Create" to create a new integration
3. Configure the redirect URL to match your application's callback endpoint

For team-based integrations, you'll need to configure the integration under your team settings rather than your personal account.
