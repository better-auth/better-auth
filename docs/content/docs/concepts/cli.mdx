Better Auth comes with a built-in CLI to help you manage the database schemas or even create new applications with Better Auth!


## Init

The `init` command allows you to initialize Better Auth in your project.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest init
```

You can also pass a list of plugins separated by a comma to the `init` command.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest init admin, organization, two-factor
```

### Options

- `--name` - The name of your application. (Defaults to your `package.json`'s `name` property.)
- `--framework` - The framework your codebase is using. Currently, the only supported framework is `nextjs`.
- `--plugins` - The plugins you want to use. You can specify multiple plugins by separating them with a comma.
- `--database` - The database you want to use. Currently, the only supported database is `sqlite`.
- `--package-manager` - The package manager you want to use. Currently, the only supported package managers are `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`. (Defaults to the manager you used to initialize the CLI.)

### How it works

1. Checks if you have `package.json` file in your project.
2. Checks if you have `lib` directory, or `src/lib` directory in your project.
3. Checks if you have `better-auth.ts` file in your project. (If not, it will create one.)
4. 


## Generate

The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Auth. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

### Options

- `--output` - Where to save the generated schema. For Prisma, it will be saved in prisma/schema.prisma. For Drizzle, it goes to schema.ts in your project root. For Kysely, it’s an SQL file saved as schema.sql in your project root.
- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a better-auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--y` - Skip the confirmation prompt and generate the schema directly.


## Migrate

The migrate command applies the Better Auth schema directly to your database. This is available if you’re using the built-in Kysely adapter.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

### Options

- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a better-auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--y` - Skip the confirmation prompt and apply the schema directly.


## Common Issues

**Error: Cannot find module X**

If you see this error, it means the CLI can’t resolve imported modules in your Better Auth config file. We're working on a fix for many of these issues, but in the meantime, you can try the following:

- Remove any import aliases in your config file and use relative paths instead. After running the CLI, you can revert to using aliases.


## Secret

The CLI also provides a way to generate a secret key for your Better Auth instance.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```
