Better Auth is designed to be type-safe. Both the client and server are built with TypeScript, allowing you to easily infer types.

## Infering Types

Both the client SDK and the server offer types that can be inferred using the `$Infer` property. Plugins can extend base types like `User` and `Session`, and you can use `$Infer` to infer these types. Additionally, plugins can provide extra types that can also be inferred through `$Infer`.

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

export type Session = typeof client.$Infer.Session
```

The `Session` type includes both `session` and `user` properties. The user property represents the user object type, and the `session` property represents the `session` object type.

You can also infer types on the server side.

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import Database from "better-sqlite3"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Database("database.db")
})

type Session = typeof auth.$Infer.Session
```
