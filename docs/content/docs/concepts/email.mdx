Email is a key part of Better Auth, required for all users regardless of their authentication method. Better Auth provides email and password authentication out of the box, and a lot of utilities to help you manage email verification, password reset, and more.


## Email Verification

Email verification is a security feature that ensures users provide a valid email address. It helps prevent spam and abuse by confirming that the email address belongs to the user.

### Adding Email Verification to Your App

To enable email verification, you need to pass a function that sends a verification email with a link.

- **sendVerificationEmail**: This function is triggered when email verification starts. It accepts a data object with the following properties:
  - `user`: The user object containing the email address.
  - `url`: The verification URL the user must click to verify their email.
  - `token`: The verification token used to complete the email verification to be used when implementing a custom verification URL.

and a `request` object as the second parameter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { sendEmail } from './email'; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailVerification: {
        sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => {
            await sendEmail({
                to: user.email,
                subject: 'Verify your email address',
                text: `Click the link to verify your email: ${url}`
            })
        }
    }
})
```

### Triggering Email Verification

You can initiate email verification in two ways:

#### 1. During Sign-up

To automatically send a verification email at signup, set `emailVerification.sendOnSignUp` to `true`. 

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailVerification: {
        sendOnSignUp: true
    }
})
```

This sends a verification email when a user signs up. For social logins, email verification status is read from the SSO.

<Callout>
    With `sendOnSignUp` enabled, when the user logs in with an SSO that does not claim the email as verified, Better Auth will dispatch a verification email, but the verification is not required to login even when `requireEmailVerification` is enabled.
</Callout>

#### 2. Require Email Verification

If you enable require email verification, users must verify their email before they can log in. And every time a user tries to sign in, `sendVerificationEmail` is called.

<Callout>
    This only works if you have `sendVerificationEmail` implemented and if the user is trying to sign in with email and password.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
        requireEmailVerification: true
    }
})
```

if a user tries to sign in without verifying their email, you can handle the error and show a message to the user.

```ts title="client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.emailAndPassword({
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password"
}, {
    onError: (ctx) => {
        // Handle the error
        if(ctx.error.status === 403) {
            alert("Please verify your email address")
        }
        //you can also show the original error message
        alert(ctx.error.message)
    }
})
```

#### 3. Manually

You can also manually trigger email verification by calling `sendVerificationEmail`.

```ts
await authClient.sendVerificationEmail({
    email: "user@email.com",
    callbackURL: "/" // The redirect URL after verification
})
```

### Verifying the Email

If the user clicks the provided verification URL, their email is automatically verified, and they are redirected to the `callbackURL`.

For manual verification, you can send the user a custom link with the `token` and call the `verifyEmail` function.

```ts
authClient.verifyEmail({
    query: {
        token: "" // Pass the token here
    }
})
```

### Auto SignIn After Verification

To sign in the user automatically after they successfully verify their email, set the `autoSignInAfterVerification` option to `true`:

```ts
const auth = betterAuth({
    //...your other options
    emailVerification: {
        autoSignInAfterVerification: true
    }
})
```

## Password Reset Email

Password reset allows users to reset their password if they forget it. Better Auth provides a simple way to implement password reset functionality.

You can enable password reset by passing a function that sends a password reset email with a link.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { sendEmail } from './email'; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
        enabled: true,
        sendResetPassword: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => {
            await sendEmail({
                to: user.email,
                subject: 'Reset your password',
                text: `Click the link to reset your password: ${url}`
            })
        }
    }
})
```
