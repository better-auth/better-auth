title: Dynamic Base URL
description: Configure Better Auth to work with multiple domains and preview deployments.
---

When deploying to platforms like Vercel, your application can run on multiple URLs simultaneously:
- Custom domains (e.g., `myapp.com`, `www.myapp.com`)
- Preview deployments (e.g., `my-app-abc123.vercel.app`)
- Branch previews (e.g., `feature-branch.myapp.com`)

Better Auth supports dynamic base URL resolution using an **allowlist-based approach** that determines the correct URL from each incoming request.

## Basic Usage

Configure `baseURL` as an object with an `allowedHosts` array:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: [
            "myapp.com",
            "www.myapp.com",
            "*.vercel.app",
        ],
    },
})
```

When a request comes in, Better Auth extracts the host from the `x-forwarded-host` or `host` header and validates it against your allowlist. If the host matches, that URL is used as the base URL for the request.

## Wildcard Patterns

The `allowedHosts` array supports wildcard patterns:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `myapp.com` | Exact match only |
| `*.vercel.app` | Any subdomain of vercel.app |
| `preview-*.myapp.com` | Subdomains starting with `preview-` |
| `localhost:*` | localhost on any port |

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: [
            "myapp.com",           // Production
            "*.vercel.app",        // All Vercel previews
            "preview-*.myapp.com", // Custom preview subdomains
            "localhost:3000",      // Local development
        ],
    },
})
```

## Fallback URL

By default, if the incoming host doesn't match any pattern in `allowedHosts`, Better Auth throws an error. You can provide a fallback URL instead:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: ["myapp.com", "*.vercel.app"],
        fallback: "https://myapp.com",
    },
})
```

With a fallback configured:
- Matching hosts use the derived URL
- Non-matching hosts use the fallback URL (no error thrown)

<Callout type="warn">
Use fallbacks carefully. Silent fallbacks can mask misconfigurations. Consider whether throwing an error (the default) is more appropriate for your use case.
</Callout>

## Protocol Configuration

Control the protocol used when constructing URLs:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: ["myapp.com", "localhost:3000"],
        protocol: "https", // Always use HTTPS
    },
})
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"https"` | Always use HTTPS |
| `"http"` | Always use HTTP |
| `"auto"` | Derive from `x-forwarded-proto` header or request URL |
| Not set | Derive from headers, default to HTTPS |

For mixed environments (local dev + production), you can use environment variables:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: ["myapp.com", "localhost:3000"],
        protocol: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "http" : "https",
    },
})
```

## Trusted Origins Integration

When you configure `allowedHosts`, Better Auth automatically adds them to `trustedOrigins`. This means:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: ["myapp.com", "*.vercel.app"],
    },
})

// Automatically adds to trustedOrigins:
// - "https://myapp.com"
// - "https://*.vercel.app"
```

You don't need to duplicate your allowed hosts in both configurations.

## Static Base URL (Backwards Compatible)

The traditional static string configuration still works:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: "https://myapp.com",
})
```

This is recommended when your application runs on a single, known URL.

## Common Patterns

### Vercel Deployment

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: [
            "myapp.com",        // Production custom domain
            "www.myapp.com",    // WWW variant
            "*.vercel.app",     // All preview deployments
        ],
    },
})
```

### Development + Production

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: [
            "localhost:3000",
            "localhost:5173",
            "myapp.com",
            "*.vercel.app",
        ],
        protocol: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "http" : "https",
    },
})
```

### Multiple Production Domains

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    baseURL: {
        allowedHosts: [
            "myapp.com",
            "myapp.co.uk",
            "myapp.eu",
        ],
    },
})
```

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="info">
Dynamic base URL uses an **allowlist-based approach** for security. Only hosts explicitly listed in `allowedHosts` are accepted.
</Callout>

1. **Allowlist is mandatory** - You cannot accept arbitrary hosts
2. **Headers are validated** - The `x-forwarded-host` and `host` headers are sanitized before use
3. **Explicit patterns only** - No automatic platform detection; you must add each pattern
4. **Clear errors** - Unknown hosts throw descriptive errors (unless fallback is set)

This differs from some other auth libraries that auto-trust platforms or accept any header value. Better Auth prioritizes security over convenience.

## Configuration Reference

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `allowedHosts` | `string[]` | Required | List of allowed host patterns |
| `fallback` | `string` | - | URL to use when host doesn't match |
| `protocol` | `"http" \| "https" \| "auto"` | Derived | Protocol to use |
