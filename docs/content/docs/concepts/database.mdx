Better Auth requires a database connection to store data. It comes with a query builder called <Link href="https://kysely.dev/"> Kysley </Link> to manage and query your database. The database will be used to store data such as users, sessions, and more. Plugins can also define their own database tables to store data.

You can pass a database connection to Better Auth by passing a supported database instance, a dialect instance or a kysely instance in the database options.

**Example: Sqlite**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import Database from "better-sqlite3"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: new Database("database.sqlite")
})
```

**Example: Postgres**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { Pool } from "pg"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({
        connectionString: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
    })
})
```

**Exmaple: Mysql**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { createPool } from "mysql2/promise"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: createPool({
        host: "localhost",
        user: "root",
        password: "password",
        database: "database"
    })
})
```

**Exmaple: Custom Dialect using libsql**

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { LibsqlDialect } from "@libsql/kysely-libsql";

export const auth = await betterAuth({
   	database: {
      dialect: new LibsqlDialect({
        url: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL || "",
        authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN || "",
      }),
      type: "sqlite" 
    },
})
```

**Example: Custom Kysely Instance**

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { db } from "./db"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
      kysely: db,
      type: "sqlite" // or "mysql", "postgres" or "mssql"
    }
})
```

## Using Adapters

If your database is managed by an ORM like Prisma or Drizzle, you can use the corresponding adapter to connect to the database. Better Auth comes with built-in adapters for Prisma and Drizzle. You can pass the adapter to the `database` object in the auth options.

### Prisma Adapter

The Prisma adapter expects a prisma client instance and a provider key that specifies the database provider to use. The provider key can be `sqlite`, `postgres`, `mysql`, or any other supported by prisma.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { PrismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
      provider: "sqlite"
    })
})
```


### Drizzle adapter

The Drizzle adapter expects a drizzle client instance and a provider key that specifies the database provider to use. The provider key can be `sqlite`, `pg` or `mysql`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
      provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql"
    })
})
```

#### Mapping Schema

The Drizzle adapter expects the schema you define to match the table names. For example, if your Drizzle schema maps the `user` table to `users`, you need to manually pass the schema and map it to the user table.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
      provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql"
      schema: {
         ...schema,
        user: schema.users,
      },
      //if all of them are just using plural form, you can just pass the option below
      usePlural: true
    })
})
```



## Running Migrations

Better Auth comes with a CLI tool to manage database migrations. Use the `migrate` command to create or update tables as needed.

The cli checks your database and prompts you to add missing tables or update existing ones with new columns.

```bash
npx better-auth migrate
```

## Running Migrations Manually and Generting Schema

Better Auth also provides a `generate` command to generate the schema required by Better Auth. The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Auth. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash
npx better-auth generate
```

See the [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) documentation for more information on the CLI.

<Callout>
If you prefer adding tables manually, you can do that as well. The core schema required by Better Auth is described below and you can find additional schema required by plugins in the plugin documentation.
</Callout>

## Core Schema

Better Auth requires the following tables to be present in the database. The types are in `typescript` format. You can use corresponding types in your database.

### User

Table Name: `user`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each user",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "User's chosen display name"
    },
    {
      name: "email",
      type: "string",
      description: "User's email address for communication and login"
    },
    {
      name: "image",
      type: "string",
      description: "User's image url",
      isOptional: true
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the user account was created"
    },
    {
      name: "updatedAt",

      name: "expiresAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "The time when the verification request expires"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Plugins Schema

Plugins can define their own tables in the database to store additional data. They can also add columns to the core tables to store additional data. For example, the two factor authentication plugin adds the following columns to the `user` table:

- `twoFactorEnabled`: Whether two factor authentication is enabled for the user.
- `twoFactorSecret`: The secret key used to generate TOTP codes.
- `twoFactorBackupCodes`: Encrypted backup codes for account recovery.

To add new tables and columns to your database, you have two options:

`CLI`: Use the migrate or generate command. These commands will scan your database and guide you through adding any missing tables or columns.
`Manual Method`: Follow the instructions in the plugin documentation to manually add tables and columns.

Both methods ensure your database schema stays up-to-date with your plugins' requirements.

## Extending the Schema

Better Auth doesn't allow you to directly extend any of the core schema. But you can always add new columns in your table and use database hooks to add or modify data during the lifecycle of core database operations.

## Database Hooks

Database hooks allow you to define custom logic that can be executed during the lifecycle of core database operations in BetterAuth. You can create hooks for the following models: **user**, **session**, and **account**.

There are two types of hooks you can define:

### 1. Before Hook

- **Purpose**: This hook is called before the respective entity (user, session, or account) is created or updated.
- **Behavior**: If the hook returns `false`, the operation will be aborted. And If it returns a data object, it'll replace the orginal payload.

### 2. After Hook

- **Purpose**: This hook is called after the respective entity is created or updated.
- **Behavior**: You can perform additional actions or modifications after the entity has been successfully created or updated.

**Example Usage**

```typescript title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
   databaseHooks: {
        user: {
          create: {
              before: async (user) => {
                  // Modify the user object before it is created
                  return {
                     data: {
                        ...user,
                        firstName: user.name.split(" ")[0],
                        lastName: user.name.split(" ")[1]
                     }
                  }
              },
              after: async (user) => {
                  //perform additional actions, like creating a stripe customer
              },
          },
      },
   }
})
```
