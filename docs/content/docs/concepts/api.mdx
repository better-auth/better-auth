When you create a new Better Auth instance, you get an object called `api` with a set of functions that you can use to interact with the server.

Any endpoint added on the server will be available on the `api` object.

## Calling API on the Server

Better Auth uses a library called [better-call](https://github.com/bekacru/better-call) to make API endpoints. It's a library made by the same team behind Better Auth and is designed to work seamlessly with it.Better call endpoints allow you to call `rest` api handlers as if they were normal functions.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        // add your plugins here
    ]
})

// calling sign in email on the server
await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "",
        password: ""
    }
})
```

**Example: Getting the current Session In Next JS**

```ts title="server.ts"
import { headers } from "next/server";

// calling get session on the server
await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: headers()
})
```

Unlike the client, the server needs the values to be passed as an object with the key `body` for the body, `headers` for the headers, and `query` for the query.


### Getting the `Response` Object

When you invoke an API endpoint on the server, it will return a standard JavaScript object or array directly. To get the `Response` object instead, you can use the `asResponse` option.

```ts title="server.ts"
const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "",
        password: ""
    },
    asResponse: true
})
```

## Error Handling

When you call an API endpoint in the server, it will throw an error if the request fails. You can catch the error and handle it as you see fit. The error instance is an instance of `APIError`.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

try {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "",
            password: ""
        }
    })
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof APIError) {
        console.log(error.message, error.status)
    }
}
```
