Beyond authenticating users, Better Auth also provides a set of methods to manage users. This includes, updating user information, changing passwords, and more.

The user table stores the authentication data of the user [Click here to view the schema](/docs/concepts/database#user).

The user table can be extended using [additional fields](/docs/concepts/database#extending-core-schema) or by plugins to store additional data.

## Update User

### Update User Information

To update user information, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client. The `updateUser` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await authClient.updateUser({
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    name: "John Doe",
})
```
### Change Email

To allow users to change their email, first enable the `changeEmail` feature, which is disabled by default. Set `changeEmail.enabled` to `true`:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        changeEmail: {
            enabled: true,
        }
    }
})
```

For users with a verified email, provide the `sendChangeEmailVerification` function. This function triggers when a user changes their email, sending a verification email with a URL and token. If the current email isn't verified, the change happens immediately without verification.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        changeEmail: {
            enabled: true,
            sendChangeEmailVerification: async ({ user, newEmail, url, token }, request) => {
                await sendEmail({
                    to: user.email, // verification email must be sent to the current user email to approve the change
                    subject: 'Approve email change',
                    text: `Click the link to approve the change: ${url}`
                })
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Once enabled, use the `changeEmail` function on the client to update a user’s email. The user must verify their current email before changing it.

```ts
await authClient.changeEmail({
    newEmail: "new-email@email.com",
    callbackURL: "/dashboard", //to redirect after verification
});
```

After verification, the new email is updated in the user table, and a confirmation is sent to the new address.

<Callout type="warn">
    If the current email is unverified, the new email is updated without the verification step.
</Callout>
 
### Change Password

Password of a user isn't stored in the user table. Instead, it's stored in the account table. To change the password of a user, you can use the `changePassword` function provided by the client. The `changePassword` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await authClient.changePassword({
    newPassword: "newPassword123",
    currentPassword: "oldPassword123",
    revokeOtherSessions: true, // revoke all other sessions the user is signed into
});
```

### Set Password

If a user was registered using OAuth or other providers, they won't have a password or a credential account. In this case, you can use the `setPassword` action to set a password for the user. For security reasons, this function can only be called from the server. We recommend having users go through a 'forgot password' flow to set a password for their account.

```ts
await auth.api.setPassword({
    body: { newPassword: "password" },
    headers: //
});
```

## Delete User

Better Auth provides a utility to hard delete a user from your database. It's disabled by default, but you can enable it easily by passing `enabled:true`

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other config
    user: {
        deleteUser: { // [!code highlight]
            enabled: true // [!code highlight]
        } // [!code highlight]
    }
})
```

Once enabled, you can call `authClient.deleteUser` to permanently delete user data from your database.

### Adding Verification Before Deletion

For added security, you’ll likely want to confirm the user’s intent before deleting their account. A common approach is to send a verification email. Better Auth provides a `sendDeleteAccountVerification` utility for this purpose.

Here’s how you can set it up:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            sendDeleteAccountVerification: async (
                {
                    user,   // The user object
                    url, // The auto-generated URL for deletion
                    token  // The verification token  (can be used to generate custom URL)
                },
                request  // The original request object (optional)
            ) => {
                // Your email sending logic here
                // Example: sendEmail(data.user.email, "Verify Deletion", data.url);
            },
        },
    },
});
```

**How callback verification works:**

- **Callback URL**: The url provided in `sendDeleteAccountVerification` is a pre-generated link that deletes the user data when accessed.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    callbackURL: "/goodbye" // you can provide a callback URL to redirect after deletion
});
```

- **Authentication Check**: The user must be signed in to the account they’re attempting to delete.
If they aren’t signed in, the deletion process will fail. 

If you have sent a custom URL, you can use the `deleteUser` method with the token to delete the user.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    token
});
```

### Authentication Requirements

To delete a user, the user must meet one of the following requirements:

1. A valid password

if the user has a password, they can delete their account by providing the password.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    password: "password"
});
```

2. Fresh session

The user must have a `fresh` session token, meaning the user must have signed in recently. This is checked if the password is not provided.

<Callout type="warn">
By default `session.freshAge` is set to `60 * 60 * 24` (1 day). You can change this value by passing the `session` object to the `auth` configuration. If it is set to `0`, the freshness check is disabled.
</Callout>

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser();
```

3. The user must provide a token generated by the `sendDeleteAccountVerification` callback.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    token
});
```

### Callbacks

**beforeDelete**: This callback is called before the user is deleted. You can use this callback to perform any cleanup or additional checks before deleting the user.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            beforeDelete: async (user) => {
                // Perform any cleanup or additional checks here
            },
        },
    },
});
```
you can also throw `APIError` to interrupt the deletion process.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            beforeDelete: async (user, request) => {
                if (user.email.includes("admin")) {
                    throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
                        message: "Admin accounts can't be deleted",
                    });
                }
            },
        },
    },
});
```

**afterDelete**: This callback is called after the user is deleted. You can use this callback to perform any cleanup or additional actions after the user is deleted.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            afterDelete: async (user, request) => {
                // Perform any cleanup or additional actions here
            },
        },
    },
});
```

## Accounts

Better Auth supports multiple authentication methods. Each authentication method is called a provider. For example, email and password authentication is a provider, Google authentication is a provider, etc.

When a user signs in using a provider, an account is created for the user. The account stores the authentication data returned by the provider. This data includes the access token, refresh token, and other information returned by the provider.

The account table stores the authentication data of the user [Click here to view the schema](/docs/concepts/database#account)


### List User Accounts

To list user accounts you can use `client.user.listAccounts` method. Which will return all accounts associated with a user.

```ts
const accounts = await authClient.listAccounts();
```
### Account Linking

Account linking enables users to associate multiple authentication methods with a single account. With Better Auth, users can connect additional social sign-ons or OAuth providers to their existing accounts if the provider confirms the user's email as verified.

If account linking is disabled, no accounts can be linked, regardless of the provider or email verification status.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            enabled: true, 
        }
    },
});
```

#### Forced Linking

You can specify a list of "trusted providers." When a user logs in using a trusted provider, their account will be automatically linked even if the provider doesn’t confirm the email verification status. Use this with caution as it may increase the risk of account takeover.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            enabled: true,
            trustedProviders: ["google", "github"]
        }
    },
});
```

#### Manually Linking Accounts

Users already signed in can manually link their account to additional social providers or credential-based accounts.

- **Linking Social Accounts:** Use the `user.linkSocial` method on the client to link a social provider to the user's account.

  ```ts
  await authClient.linkSocial({
      provider: "google", // Provider to link
      callbackURL: "/callback" // Callback URL after linking completes
  });
  ```

  You can also request specific scopes when linking a social account, which can be different from the scopes used during the initial authentication:

  ```ts
  await authClient.linkSocial({
      provider: "google",
      callbackURL: "/callback",
      scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"] // Request additional scopes
  });
  ```

  If you want your users to be able to link a social account with a different email address than the user, or if you want to use a provider that does not return email addresses, you will need to enable this in the account linking settings. 
  ```ts title="auth.ts"
  export const auth = betterAuth({
      account: {
          accountLinking: {
              allowDifferentEmails: true
          }
      },
  });
  ```

- **Linking Credential-Based Accounts:** To link a credential-based account (e.g., email and password), users can initiate a "forgot password" flow, or you can call the `setPassword` method on the server. 

  ```ts
  await auth.api.setPassword({
      headers: /* headers containing the user's session token */,
      password: /* new password */
  });
  ```

<Callout>
`setPassword` can't be called from the client for security reasons.
</Callout>

### Account Unlinking

You can unlink a user account by providing a `providerId`.

```ts
await authClient.unlinkAccount({
    providerId: "google"
});

// Unlink a specific account
await authClient.unlinkAccount({
    providerId: "google",
    accountId: "123"
});
```

If the account doesn't exist, it will throw an error. Additionally, if the user only has one account, the unlinking process will fail to prevent account lockout unless `allowUnlinkingAll` is set to `true`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            allowUnlinkingAll: true
        }
    },
});
```
