description: Better Auth Session Management
---

Better Auth manages session using a traditional cookie-based session management. The session is stored in a cookie and is sent to the server on every request. The server then verifies the session and returns the user data if the session is valid.

## Session table

The session table stores the session data. The session table has the following fields:

- `id`: The session id. Which is also used as the session cookie.
- `userId`: The user id of the user.
- `expiresAt`: The expiration date of the session.
- `ipAddress`: The IP address of the user.
- `userAgent`: The user agent of the user. It stores the user agent header from the request.

## Session Expiration

The session expires after 7 days by default. But whenever the session is used, and the `updateAge` is reached the session expiration is updated to the current time plus the `expiresIn` value.

You can change both the `expiresIn` and `updateAge` values by passing the `session` object to the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
        updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24 // 1 day (every 1 day the session expiration is updated)
    }
})
```

## Session Management

Better Auth provides a set of functions to manage sessions.

### Get Session

The `getSession` function retrieves the current active session.

```ts client="client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const session = await authClient.getSession()
```

### Use Session

The `useSession` action provides a reactive way to access the current session.

```ts client="client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const session = await authClient.useSession()
```

### List Sessions

The `listSessions` function returns a list of sessions that are active for the user.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const sessions = await authClient.listSessions()
```

### Revoke Session

When a user signs out of a device, the session is automatically ended. However, you can also end a session manually from any device the user is signed into.

To end a session, use the `revokeSession` function. Just pass the session ID as a parameter.

```ts title="client.ts"
await authClient.revokeSession({
    id: session.id,
})
```

### Revoke All Sessions

To revoke all sessions, you can use the `revokeSessions` function.

```ts title="client.ts"
await authClient.revokeSessions()
```

### Revoking Sessions on Password Change

You can revoke all sessions when the user changes their password by passing `revokeOtherSessions` true on `changePAssword` function.

```ts title="auth.ts"
await authClient.changePassword({
    newPassword: newPassword,
    currentPassword: currentPassword,
    revokeOtherSessions: signOutDevices,
})
```

## Session Caching

### Cookie Cache

Calling your database every time `useSession` or `getSession` invoked isn’t ideal, especially if sessions don’t change frequently. Cookie caching handles this by storing session data in a short-lived, signed cookie—similar to how JWT access tokens are used with refresh tokens.

When cookie caching is enabled, the server can check session validity from the cookie itself instead of hitting the database each time. The cookie is signed to prevent tampering, and a short `maxAge` ensures that the session data gets refreshed regularly. If a session is revoked or expires, the cookie will be invalidated automatically.

To turn on cookie caching, just set `session.cookieCache` in your auth config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = new BetterAuth({
    session: {
        cookieCache: {
            enabled: true,
            maxAge: 5 * 60 // Cache duration in seconds
        }
    }
});
```

If you want to disable returning from the cookie cache when fetching the session, you can pass `disableCookieCache:true`

```ts title="client.ts"
const session = await authClient.getSession({ query: {
    disableCookieCache: true
}})
```

or on the server

```ts title="server.ts"
auth.api.getSession({
    query: {
        disableCookieCache: true,
    }, 
    headers: req.headers, // pass the headers
});
```
