description: Better Auth Session Management

Better Auth manages session using a traditional cookie-based session management. The session is stored in a cookie and is sent to the server on every request. The server then verifies the session and returns the user data if the session is valid.

## Session table

The session table stores the session data. The session table has the following fields:

- `id`: The session id. Which is also used as the session cookie.
- `userId`: The user id of the user.
- `expiresAt`: The expiration date of the session.
- `ipAddress`: The IP address of the user.
- `userAgent`: The user agent of the user. It stores the user agent header from the request.

## Session Expiration

The session expires after 7 days by default. But whenever the session is used, and the `updateAge` is reached the session expiration is updated to the current time plus the `expiresIn` value.

You can change both the `expiresIn` and `updateAge` values by passing the `session` object to the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        expiresIn: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days,
        updateAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 // 1 day (every 1 day the session expiration is updated)
    }
})
```

## Session Management

Better Auth provides a set of functions to manage sessions.

### List Sessions

The `listSessions` function returns a list of sessions that are active for the user.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { client } from "@/lib/client"

const sessions = await client.user.listSessions()
```

### Revoke Session

When a user signs out of a device, the session is automatically ended. However, you can also end a session manually from any device the user is signed into.

To end a session, use the `revokeSession` function. Just pass the session ID as a parameter.

```ts title="client.ts"
await client.user.revokeSession({
    id: session.id,
})
```

### Revoke All Sessions

To revoke all sessions, you can use the `revokeSessions` function.

```ts title="client.ts"
await client.user.revokeSessions()
```

### Revoking Sessions on Password Change

You can revoke all sessions when the user changes their password by passing `revokeOtherSessions` true on `changePAssword` function.

```ts title="auth.ts"
await user.changePassword({
    newPassword: newPassword,
    currentPassword: currentPassword,
    revokeOtherSessions: signOutDevices,
})
```
