description: Learn how cookies are used in BetterAuth
---

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, CSRF tokens, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

Core Better Auth cookies like `session` and `csrf` will follow `betterauth.${cookie_name}` format.

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode.

### Cross Subdomain Cookies (ðŸ§ª Experimental)

Sometimes you may need to share cookies across subdomains. For example, if you have `app.example.com` and `example.com`, and if you authenticate on `example.com`, you may want to access the same session on `app.example.com`.

By default, cookies are not shared between subdomains. However, if you need to access the same session across different subdomains, you can enable cross-subdomain cookies. To do this, set `crossSubDomainCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

Keep in mind that this does not imply that all cookies will be shared across subdomains; only a specific subset of cookies necessary for session sharing will be set.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "example.com" // Optional. Defaults to the base url domain
        }
    }
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
This feature is experimental and may not work as expected in all scenarios. And this is specefically to share session cookies across subdomains.
</Callout>

### Disable CSRF Cookie (âš ï¸Ž Not Recommended)

If you want to disable the CSRF cookie, you can set `disableCsrfCheck` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options. If you disable the CSRF cookie, you should make sure that your framework handles CSRF protection itself.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        disableCSRFCheck: true
    }
})
```

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure if the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```

## CSRF Protection

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection in Better Auth**

Better Auth protects your app from CSRF attacks in two ways:

1. **Secure Cookies**: All cookies are marked as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and use the `SameSite=Lax` attribute. This ensures theyâ€™re inaccessible to client-side scripts, only sent over HTTPS, and not shared across sites. 

2. **CSRF Tokens**: By default, CSRF token checks are disabled for the same origin as `baseURL`, since CSRF attacks only affect browser requests. For other origins, CSRF tokens are required for `POST` requests. It uses double submit cookies to validate the token. Each session has a unique CSRF token that is sent as a cookie and a header in every request. If the two donâ€™t match, the request is rejected.

You can adjust this behavior:
- Use `disableCSRFTokenCheck: true` on the client to skip token checks entirely. 
- To allow untrusted origins, specify them in the `trustedOrigins` option on the server. These origins will be exempt from CSRF checks.

Untrusted requests without valid tokens will result in a `403` error.

<Callout type="warn">
You can also disable CSRF token check for all clients by setting `advanced.disableCSRFCheck` option on the server. You should only do this if your framework handles CSRF protection itself.
</Callout>
