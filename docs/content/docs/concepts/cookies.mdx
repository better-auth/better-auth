description: Learn how cookies are used in BetterAuth

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, OAuth state, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

Core Better Auth cookies will follow `betterauth.${cookie_name}` format.

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode.

### Cross Subdomain Cookies (ðŸ§ª Experimental)

Sometimes you may need to share cookies across subdomains. For example, if you have `app.example.com` and `example.com`, and if you authenticate on `example.com`, you may want to access the same session on `app.example.com`.

By default, cookies are not shared between subdomains. However, if you need to access the same session across different subdomains, you can enable cross-subdomain cookies. To do this, set `crossSubDomainCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

Keep in mind that this does not imply that all cookies will be shared across subdomains; only a specific subset of cookies necessary for session sharing will be set.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "example.com" // Optional. Defaults to the base url domain
        }
    }
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
This feature is experimental and may not work as expected in all scenarios. And this is specefically to share session cookies across subdomains.
</Callout>

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure if the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```
