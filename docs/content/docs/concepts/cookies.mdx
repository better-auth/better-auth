description: Learn how cookies are used in Better Auth.
---

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, OAuth state, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

### Cookie Prefix

By default, Better Auth cookies follow the format `${prefix}.${cookie_name}`. The default prefix is "better-auth". You can change the prefix by setting `cookiePrefix` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookiePrefix: "my-app"
    }
})
```

### Custom Cookies

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` when the server is running in production mode.

If you want to set custom cookie names and attributes, you can do so by setting `cookieOptions` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

By default, Better Auth uses the following cookies:

- `session_token` to store the session token
- `session_data` to store the session data if cookie cache is enabled
- `dont_remember` to store the flag when `rememberMe` is disabled

Plugins may also use cookies to store data. For example, the Two Factor Authentication plugin uses the `two_factor` cookie to store the two-factor authentication state.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookies: {
            session_token: {
                name: "custom_session_token",
                attributes: {
                    // Set custom cookie attributes
                }
            },
        }
    }
})
```

### Cross Subdomain Cookies

Sometimes you may need to share cookies across subdomains. 
For example, if you authenticate on `auth.example.com`, you may also want to access the same session on `app.example.com`.

<Callout type="warn">
The `domain` attribute controls which domains can access the cookie. Setting it to your root domain (e.g. `example.com`) makes the cookie accessible across all subdomains. For security, follow these guidelines:

1. Only enable cross-subdomain cookies if it's necessary
2. Set the domain to the most specific scope needed (e.g. `app.example.com` instead of `.example.com`)
3. Be cautious of untrusted subdomains that could potentially access these cookies
4. Consider using separate domains for untrusted services (e.g. `status.company.com` vs `app.company.com`)
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "app.example.com", // your domain
        },
    },
    trustedOrigins: [
        'https://example.com',
        'https://app1.example.com',
        'https://app2.example.com',
    ],
})
```
### Cross-Domain Cookies (Different Domains)

<Callout type="error">
Cross-domain cookies (between completely different domains) are **not supported** and will not work reliably in modern browsers. This is a fundamental browser security limitation, not a framework limitation.
</Callout>

#### Why Cross-Domain Cookies Don't Work

**1. Modern browsers block third-party cookies by default**
- Most browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome) block third-party cookies to protect user privacy
- Even with the `Partitioned` flag, support is inconsistent across browsers

**2. Server-side rendering breaks**
- Even if a cookie is set from one domain for another, the server on the second domain cannot read it
- This makes SSR fail, breaking fullstack applications
- Only works partially for pure SPAs, but even then unreliably

**3. Browser security model**
- Cookies are designed to be domain-specific for security reasons
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other attacks are prevented by this model

#### Recommended Alternatives

Instead of trying to use cross-domain cookies, consider these reliable approaches:

**1. Use a reverse proxy or rewrites**
- Configure your framework's rewrites to proxy API calls
- This makes both frontend and backend appear to be on the same domain
- Example: Frontend on `app.com` proxies API calls to `/api/*` which forwards to your backend

**2. Deploy under a shared domain**
- Use subdomains under the same parent domain (e.g., `app.example.com` and `api.example.com`)
- Configure cross-subdomain cookies as shown in the section above
- Deploy through platforms that support custom domains or use DNS providers

**3. Token-based authentication (SPA only)**
- Store tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Send tokens in request headers instead of cookies
- Note: This disables SSR and only works for client-side applications

**4. Use authentication providers**
- Consider using authentication services that handle cross-domain scenarios
- These typically use OAuth flows or similar mechanisms designed for cross-domain authentication

<Callout type="info">
Remember: Cross-site cookies are fundamentally incompatible with modern browser security models. Always design your architecture with same-origin or subdomain strategies in mind.
</Callout>

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure only when the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be always secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```
