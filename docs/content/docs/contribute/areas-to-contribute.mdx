## Working on Issues

The easiest way to start contributing is by tackling existing issues. Here's how:

1. Check our [github issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues) for issues labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted` or `question`
2. Comment on the issue you'd like to work on to avoid duplicate efforts
3. If you've found a bug or have a feature request not listed, please create a new issue:
   - For bugs: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
   - For features: Describe the feature and its use cases

## Framework Integrations

Better Auth aims to support as many frameworks as possible in the JavaScript ecosystem. Here's how you can help expand our framework support:

### Adding New Framework Support
1. Start with documentation for basic integration
2. Focus on framework-agnostic solutions where possible
3. Keep integrations minimal and maintainable

### Integration Guidelines
- Prefer framework-agnostic solutions over framework-specific ones
- Keep server-side integrations as thin as possible
- All integrations currently live in the main package (packages/better-auth)
- Focus on reducing implementation friction while maintaining flexibility

### Current Structure
We currently maintain all integrations (frameworks, plugins, utilities) in a single package for simplicity. As the project grows, we may consider splitting these into separate packages.

## Plugin Development

Want to extend Better Auth's functionality? Here's our plugin contribution process:

### Core Plugins
1. **Open an Issue First**: Describe your plugin idea
2. **Get Approval**: Wait for team feedback before starting
3. **Development**: Follow our <Link href="/docs/guides/your-first-plugin">plugin development guide</Link>

### Community Plugins

## Core Feature Development

Contributing to core features requires careful coordination:

### Process
1. **Open an Issue**: Describe the feature and its use cases
2. **Discussion**: Get feedback from the team and community
3. **Planning**: Outline implementation approach
4. **Development**: Create a draft PR early for guidance

### Best Practices
- Start with a minimal viable implementation
- Include tests and documentation
- Keep backwards compatibility in mind
- Follow our coding standards

## Security Contributions

Security is our top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Send details to security@better-auth.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
