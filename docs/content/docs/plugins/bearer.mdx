The Bearer plugin allows you to authenticate with a Bearer token instead of a browser cookie. It proxies the request and set the bearer token in the Authorization header to a cookie request internally.

## Add the Bearer plugin

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { bearer } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [bearer()]
});
```
