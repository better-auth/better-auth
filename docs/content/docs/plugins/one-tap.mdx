description: One Tap plugin for Better Auth

The One Tap plugin allows users to login with a single tap using Google's One Tap API.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the server Plugin

Add the One Tap plugin to your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oneTap } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        oneTap(), // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
        ### Add the client Plugin

        Add the client plugin and Specify where the user should be redirected if they need to verify 2nd factor

        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { oneTapClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                oneTapClient({
                    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
        </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

To make the one tap pop up appear, you can call the `oneTap` method.

```ts
await authClient.oneTap()
```

By default, the plugin will automatically redirect the user to "/" after the user has successfully logged in. It does a hard redirect, so the page will be reloaded. If you want to 
avoid this, you can pass `fetchOptions` to the `oneTap` method.

```tsx
authClient.oneTap({
    fetchOptions: {
        onSuccess: () => {
            router.push("/dashboard")
        }
    }
})
```

If you want it to hard redirect to a different page, you can pass the `callbackURL` option to the `oneTap` method.

```tsx
authClient.oneTap({
    callbackURL: "/dashboard"
})
```

## Client Options

**clientId**: The client ID of your Google One Tap API

**autoSelect**: Automatically select the first account in the list. Default is `false`

**context**: The context in which the One Tap API should be used. Default is `signin`

**cancelOnTapOutside**: Cancel the One Tap popup when the user taps outside of the popup. Default is `true`.

## Server Options

**disableSignUp**: Disable the sign up option. Default is `false`. If set to `true`, the user will only be able to sign in with an existing account.
