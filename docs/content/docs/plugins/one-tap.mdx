description: One Tap plugin for Better Auth
---

The One Tap plugin allows users to log in with a single tap using Google's One Tap API. The plugin
provides a simple way to integrate One Tap into your application, handling the client-side and server-side logic for you.

<Callout type="info">
**FedCM Support**: This plugin supports both traditional Google One Tap (iframe-based) and the modern FedCM (Federated Credential Management) API. FedCM is a browser-native authentication standard that doesn't rely on third-party cookies. Both methods provide the same user experience but use different underlying technologies.
</Callout>

## Installation

### Add the Server Plugin

Add the One Tap plugin to your auth configuration:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oneTap } from "better-auth/plugins"; // [!code highlight]

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        oneTap(), // Add the One Tap server plugin  // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
});
```

### Add the Client Plugin

Add the client plugin and specify where the user should be redirected after sign-in or if additional verification (like 2FA) is needed.


```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { oneTapClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    oneTapClient({
      clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      // Optional client configuration:
      autoSelect: false,
      cancelOnTapOutside: true,
      context: "signin",
      additionalOptions: {
        // Any extra options for the Google initialize method
      },
      // Configure prompt behavior and exponential backoff:
      promptOptions: {
        baseDelay: 1000,   // Base delay in ms (default: 1000)
        maxAttempts: 5     // Maximum number of attempts before triggering onPromptNotification (default: 5)
      }
    })
  ]
});
```

### Usage

To display the One Tap popup, simply call the oneTap method on your auth client:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap();
```

### Customizing Redirect Behavior

By default, after a successful login the plugin will hard redirect the user to `/`. You can customize this behavior as follows:

#### Avoiding a Hard Redirect

Pass fetchOptions with an onSuccess callback to handle the login response without a page reload:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  fetchOptions: {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // For example, use a router to navigate without a full reload:
      router.push("/dashboard");
    }
  }
});
```

#### Specifying a Custom Callback URL

To perform a hard redirect to a different page after login, use the callbackURL option:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  callbackURL: "/dashboard"
});
```

#### Handling Prompt Dismissals with Exponential Backoff

If the user dismisses or skips the prompt, the plugin will retry showing the One Tap prompt using exponential backoff based on your configured promptOptions.

If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful sign-in, you can use the onPromptNotification callback to be notifiedâ€”allowing you to render an alternative UI (e.g., a traditional Google Sign-In button) so users can restart the process manually:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  onPromptNotification: (notification) => {
    console.warn("Prompt was dismissed or skipped. Consider displaying an alternative sign-in option.", notification);
    // Render your alternative UI here
  }
});
```

### Client Options

- **clientId**: The client ID for your Google One Tap API.
- **autoSelect**: Automatically select the account if the user is already signed in. Default is false.
- **context**: The context in which the One Tap API should be used (e.g., "signin"). Default is "signin".
- **cancelOnTapOutside**: Cancel the One Tap popup when the user taps outside it. Default is true.
- additionalOptions: Extra options to pass to Google's initialize method as per the [Google Identity Services docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#google.accounts.id.prompt).
- **promptOptions**: Configuration for the prompt behavior and exponential backoff:
- **baseDelay**: Base delay in milliseconds for retries. Default is 1000.
- **maxAttempts**: Maximum number of prompt attempts before invoking the onPromptNotification callback. Default is 5.

### Server Options

- **disableSignUp**:  Disable the sign-up option, allowing only existing users to sign in. Default is `false`.
- **clientId**: Optionally, pass a client ID here if it is not provided in your social provider configuration.
- **enableFedCM**: Enable FedCM (Federated Credential Management) support. Default is `false`. See [FedCM Support](#fedcm-support) section for details.
- **fedcm**: FedCM configuration options (only used when `enableFedCM` is `true`):
  - **privacyPolicyUrl**: URL to your privacy policy (required for production)
  - **termsOfServiceUrl**: URL to your terms of service (required for production)
  - **branding**: Customize the FedCM dialog appearance
    - **backgroundColor**: Background color (hex)
    - **color**: Text color (hex)
    - **iconUrl**: URL to your icon image (must be HTTPS)

## FedCM Support

### What is FedCM?

FedCM (Federated Credential Management) is a browser-native API that provides privacy-preserving authentication without relying on third-party cookies. It's a W3C standard supported by Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+.

**Key differences**:
- **Traditional One Tap**: Uses iframe and third-party cookies
- **FedCM**: Uses browser-native API, no third-party cookies needed

**Important**: The user experience is identical in both modes. FedCM is just a different technical implementation.

### Fixing CORS Errors (Chrome 108+)

If you're seeing errors like "Server did not send the correct CORS headers" or "FedCM get() rejects with IdentityCredentialError", it's because Chrome is trying to use FedCM but the server doesn't support it yet.

**Quick Fix** - Disable FedCM (recommended for now):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
oneTapClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
  additionalOptions: {
    use_fedcm_for_prompt: false  // Disable FedCM, use traditional mode
  }
})
```

### Enabling FedCM

<Callout type="warning">
**Browser Support**: FedCM is currently only supported in Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+. Safari and Firefox don't support it yet. The plugin will automatically fall back to traditional mode in unsupported browsers.
</Callout>

To enable FedCM support on the server:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oneTap } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    oneTap({
      enableFedCM: true,  // Enable FedCM endpoints
      fedcm: {
        privacyPolicyUrl: "https://your-domain.com/privacy",
        termsOfServiceUrl: "https://your-domain.com/terms",
        branding: {
          backgroundColor: "#1a73e8",  // Google blue
          color: "#ffffff",
          iconUrl: "https://your-domain.com/icon-192.png"
        }
      }
    })
  ],
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!
    }
  }
});
```

**Client configuration** (optional):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
oneTapClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
  // Let Google automatically choose between FedCM and traditional mode
  // based on browser support
  additionalOptions: {
    // use_fedcm_for_prompt: true  // Optional: explicitly enable FedCM
  }
})
```

### FedCM Requirements

When `enableFedCM` is enabled, the following endpoints will be created:

- `GET /.well-known/web-identity` - FedCM discovery endpoint
- `GET /one-tap/fedcm/config` - FedCM configuration
- `GET /one-tap/fedcm/accounts` - User accounts list
- `GET /one-tap/fedcm/client-metadata` - Client metadata
- `POST /one-tap/fedcm/assertion` - ID token generation

**HTTPS Requirement**: FedCM requires HTTPS. For local development, you can use:

```bash
# Next.js
next dev --experimental-https

# Or use ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

### Migration Strategy

**Recommended approach**:

1. **Now**: Use traditional mode, disable FedCM
   ```ts
   additionalOptions: { use_fedcm_for_prompt: false }
   ```

2. **Future**: When you're ready, enable FedCM on the server
   ```ts
   oneTap({ enableFedCM: true })
   ```

3. **Let Google handle it**: The Google script will automatically choose the best method based on browser support

<Callout type="info">
**Gradual Migration**: You don't need to choose one or the other. With FedCM enabled on the server, Google's script will use FedCM in supported browsers and automatically fall back to traditional mode in unsupported browsers.
</Callout>

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Server did not send the correct CORS headers"**
- **Solution**: Disable FedCM with `use_fedcm_for_prompt: false` in `additionalOptions`

**Issue: "FedCM endpoints not found"**
- **Solution**: Make sure `enableFedCM: true` is set in server configuration

**Issue: "Invalid client_id"**
- **Solution**: Ensure the same `clientId` is used in both server and client configuration

**Issue: "Empty accounts list"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in and cookies are being sent correctly
