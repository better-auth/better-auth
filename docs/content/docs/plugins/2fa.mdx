`OTP` `TOTP` `Backup Codes` `Trusted Devices`

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra security step when users log in. Instead of just using a password, they'll need to provide a second form of verification. This makes it much harder for unauthorized people to access accounts, even if they've somehow gotten the password.

This plugin offers two main methods to do a second factor verification:

1. **OTP (One-Time Password)**: A temporary code sent to the user's email or phone.
2. **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: A code generated by an app on the user's device.

**Additional features include:**
- Generating backup codes for account recovery
- Enabling/disabling 2FA
- Managing trusted devices


## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the plugin to your auth config

        Add the two-factor plugin to your auth configuration and specify your app name as the issuer.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            // ... other config options
            plugins: [
                twoFactor({  // [!code highlight]
                    issuer: "my-app" // [!code highlight]
                }) // [!code highlight]
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
        <Step>
            ### Migrate your database:
            Run the migration to add the required fields to the user table.

            See the [schema-section](#schema) to see what fields this plugin requires.

            ```bash
            npx better-auth migrate
            ```
        </Step>

        <Step>
        ### Add the client Plugin

        Add the client plugin and Specify where the user should be redirected if they need to verify 2nd factor

        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                twoFactorClient({
                    twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" //redirect for two factor verification if enabled // [!code highlight]
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
        </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Enabling 2FA

To enable two-factor for a user you need to call `twoFactor.enable` with the user `password`.

```ts title="two-factor.ts"
const enableTwoFactor = async() => {
    await client.twoFactor.enable({
        password: "password" //the user password must be provided
    })
}
```

When a user enables two-factor authentication, 2 things happen:

- An encrypted `twoFactorSecret` and `twoFactorBackupCodes` are generated.
- `twoFactorEnabled` is set to `true`

### Sign In with 2FA

When a user with 2FA enabled tries to sign in via email, they will be redirected to the `twoFactorPage` (specified in your client config) unless they're using a trusted device.

```ts title="sign-in.ts"
const signin = async () => {
    await client.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "password123",
    })
}
```

By default, if a user has 2FA enabled, they will be redirected to the `twoFactorPage`. If you want to manage the 2FA verification directly within your application instead, simply pass `redirect:false` to the client plugin and handle the verification in the callback.

```ts title="sing-in.ts"
import { client } from "better-auth/client";
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [twoFactorClient({
        redirect: false
    })]
})

const signin = async () => {
    await client.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "password123",
    }, {
         async onSuccess(context) {
                if (context.data.twoFactorRedirect) {
                    // Handle the 2FA verification in place
                }
        }
    })
}
```


### TOTP

TOTP is a time-based one-time password algorithm that generates a code based on the current time.

#### Getting TOTP URI

After enabling 2FA, you can get the TOTP URI to display to the user.

```ts
const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.getTotpUri()
if (data) {
    // Use data.totpURI to generate a QR code or display to the user
}
```

**Example: Using React**

```tsx title="user-card.tsx"
import QRCode from "react-qr-code";

export default function UserCard(){
    const { data: session } = client.useSession();
	const { data: qr } = useQuery({
		queryKey: ["two-factor-qr"],
		queryFn: async () => {
			const res = await client.twoFactor.getTotpUri();
			return res.data;
		},
		enabled: !!session?.user.twoFactorEnabled,
	});
    return (
        <QRCode value={qr?.totpURI || ""} />
   )
}
```

#### Verifying TOTP

After the user has entered their 2FA code, you can verify it usinng `twoFacotr.verifyTotp` method.

```ts
const verifyTotp = async (code: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp({ code })
}
```

### OTP

OTP (One-Time Password) is similar to TOTP but the code is sent directly to the user, and the code is valid for 3 mins by default.

Before using OTP to verify the second factor, you need to configure `sendOTP` in your Better Auth instance. This function is responsible for sending the OTP to the user's email, phone, or any other method supported by your application.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        twoFactor({
          	otpOptions: {
				async sendOTP(user, otp) {
                    // send otp to user
				},
			},
        })
    ]
})
```

#### Sending OTP

Sending an OTP is done by calling the `twoFactor.sendOtp` function. This function will trigger your sendOTP implementation that you provided in the Better Auth configuration.

```ts
const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.sendOtp()
if (data) {
    // redirect or show the user to enter the code
}
```

#### Verifying OTP

After the user has entered their OTP code, you can verify it

```ts
const verifyOtp = async (code: string) => {
    await client.twoFactor.verifyOtp({ code }, {
        onSuccess(){
            //redirect the user on success
        },
        onError(ctx){
            alert(ctx.error.message)
        }
    })
}
```

### Backup Codes

Backup codes are generated and stored in the database. This can be used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.

#### Generating Backup Codes
Generate backup codes for account recovery:

```ts
const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.generateBackupCodes()
if (data) {
    // Show the backup codes to the user
}
```

#### Using Backup Codes

You can now allow users to provider backup code as account recover method.

```ts
await client.twoFactor.verifyBackupCode({code: ""}, {
    onSuccess(){
        //redirect the user on success
    },
    onError(ctx){
        alert(ctx.error.message)
    }
})
```

### Trusted Devices

You can mark a device as trusted by passing `trustDevice` to `verifyTotp` or `verifyOtp`.

```ts
const verify2FA = async (code: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp({
        code,
        callbackURL: "/dashboard",
        trustDevice: true // Mark this device as trusted
    })
    if (data) {
        // 2FA verified and device trusted
    }
}
```

When `trustDevice` is set to `true`, the current device will be remembered for 60 days. During this period, the user won't be prompted for 2FA on subsequent sign-ins from this device. The trust period is refreshed each time the user signs in successfully.


## Schema

The plugin requires 3 additional fields in the `user` table.

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "twoFactorEnabled", type: "boolean", description: "Whether two factor authentication is enabled for the user.", isOptional: true },
        { name: "twoFactorSecret", type: "string", description: "The secret key used to generate TOTP codes.", isOptional: true },
        { name: "twoFactorBackupCodes", type: "string", description: "Encrypted backup codes for account recovery.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>

            type: "function",
        },
    }}
/>

### Client

To use the two factor plugin in the client, you need to add it on your plugins list.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        twoFactorClient({ // [!code highlight]
            twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```


**Options**

`twoFactorPage`: The page to redirect the user to after they have enabled 2-Factor. This is the page where the user will be redirected to verify their 2-Factor code.

`redirect`: If set to `false`, the user will not be redirected to the `twoFactorPage` after they have enabled 2-Factor.
