`OTP` `TOTP` `Backup Codes` `Trusted Devices`

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra security step when users log in. Instead of just using a password, they'll need to provide a second form of verification. This makes it much harder for unauthorized people to access accounts, even if they've somehow gotten the password.

This plugin offers two main methods to do a second factor verification:

1. **OTP (One-Time Password)**: A temporary code sent to the user's email or phone.
2. **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: A code generated by an app on the user's device.

**Additional features include:**
- Generating backup codes for account recovery
- Enabling/disabling 2FA
- Managing trusted devices


## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the plugin to your auth config

        Add the two-factor plugin to your auth configuration and specify your app name as the issuer.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            // ... other config options
            appName: "My App", // provide your app name. It'll be used as an issuer. // [!code highlight]
            plugins: [
                twoFactor() // [!code highlight]
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
      <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

        <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        Add the client plugin and Specify where the user should be redirected if they need to verify 2nd factor

        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                twoFactorClient({
                    twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" //redirect for two factor verification is required // [!code highlight]
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
        </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Enabling 2FA

To enable two-factor authentication, call `twoFactor.enable` with the user's password:

```ts title="two-factor.ts"
const { data } = await authClient.twoFactor.enable({
    password: "password" // user password required
})
```

When 2FA is enabled:
- An encrypted `secret` and `backupCodes` are generated.
- `enable` returns `totpURI` and `backupCodes`.

Note: `twoFactorEnabled` won’t be set to `true` until the user verifies their TOTP code.

To verify, display the QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator app. After they enter the code, call `verifyTotp`:

```ts
await authClient.twoFactor.verifyTotp({
    code: "" // user input
})
```

<Callout>
You can skip verification by setting `skipVerificationOnEnable` to true in your plugin config.
</Callout>

### Sign In with 2FA

When a user with 2FA enabled tries to sign in via email, they will be redirected to the `twoFactorPage` (specified in your client config) unless they're using a trusted device.

```ts title="sign-in.ts"
await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "user@example.com",
    password: "password123",
})
```

By default, if a user has 2FA enabled, they will be redirected to the `twoFactorPage`. If you want to manage the 2FA verification directly within your application instead, simply pass `redirect:false` to the client plugin and handle the verification in the callback.

```ts title="sign-in.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [twoFactorClient({
        redirect: false
    })]
})

await authClient.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "password123",
    }, {
        async onSuccess(context) {
            if (context.data.twoFactorRedirect) {
                // Handle the 2FA verification in place
            }
        }
    }
})
```

#### Using `auth.api`

When you call `auth.api.signInEmail` on the server, and the user has 2FA enabled, it will, by default, respond with an object where `twoFactorRedirect` is set to `true`. This behavior isn’t inferred in TypeScript, which can be misleading. We recommend passing `asResponse: true` to receive the Response object instead.

```ts
const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
    email: "my-email@email.com",
    password: "secure-password",
    asResponse: true
})
```
s
### TOTP

TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) is an algorithm that generates a unique password for each login attempt using time as a counter. Every fixed interval (Better Auth deafults to 30 seconds), a new password is generated. This addresses several issues with traditional passwords: they can be forgotten, stolen, or guessed. OTPs solve some of these problems, but their delivery via SMS or email can be unreliable (or even risky, considering it opens new attack vectors).

TOTP, however, generates codes offline, making it both secure and convenient. You just need an authenticator app on your phone, and you’re set—no internet required.

#### Getting TOTP URI

After enabling 2FA, you can get the TOTP URI to display to the user. This URI is generated by the server using the `secret` and `issuer` and can be used to generate a QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator app.

```ts
const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.getTotpUri({
    password: "password" // user password required
})
```

**Example: Using React**

```tsx title="user-card.tsx"
import QRCode from "react-qr-code";

export default function UserCard(){
    const { data: session } = client.useSession();
	const { data: qr } = useQuery({
		queryKey: ["two-factor-qr"],
		queryFn: async () => {
			const res = await client.twoFactor.getTotpUri();
			return res.data;
		},
		enabled: !!session?.user.twoFactorEnabled,
	});
    return (
        <QRCode value={qr?.totpURI || ""} />
   )
}
```

<Callout>
By default the issuer for TOTP is set to the app name provided in the auth config or if not provided it will be set to `Better Auth`. You can override this by passing `issuer` to the plugin config.
</Callout>

#### Verifying TOTP

After the user has entered their 2FA code, you can verify it using `twoFactor.verifyTotp` method.

```ts
const verifyTotp = async (code: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp({ code })
}
```

### OTP

OTP (One-Time Password) is similar to TOTP but the code is sent directly to the user, and the code is valid for 3 mins by default.

Before using OTP to verify the second factor, you need to configure `sendOTP` in your Better Auth instance. This function is responsible for sending the OTP to the user's email, phone, or any other method supported by your application.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        twoFactor({
          	otpOptions: {
				async sendOTP({ user, otp }, request) {
                    // send otp to user
				},
			},
        })
    ]
})
```

#### Sending OTP

Sending an OTP is done by calling the `twoFactor.sendOtp` function. This function will trigger your sendOTP implementation that you provided in the Better Auth configuration.

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.twoFactor.sendOtp()
if (data) {
    // redirect or show the user to enter the code
}
```

#### Verifying OTP

After the user has entered their OTP code, you can verify it

```ts
const verifyOtp = async (code: string) => {
    await authClient.twoFactor.verifyOtp({ code }, {
        onSuccess(){
            //redirect the user on success
        },
        onError(ctx){
            alert(ctx.error.message)
        }
    })
}
```

### Backup Codes

Backup codes are generated and stored in the database. This can be used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.

#### Generating Backup Codes
Generate backup codes for account recovery:

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.twoFactor.generateBackupCodes({
    password: "password" // user password required
})
if (data) {
    // Show the backup codes to the user
}
```

#### Using Backup Codes

You can now allow users to provider backup code as account recover method.

```ts
await authClient.twoFactor.verifyBackupCode({code: ""}, {
    onSuccess(){
        //redirect the user on success
    },
    onError(ctx){
        alert(ctx.error.message)
    }
})
```

once a backup code is used, it will be removed from the database and can't be used again.

#### Viewing Backup Codes

You can view the backup codes at any time by calling `viewBackupCodes`. This action can only be performed on the server using `auth.api`.

```ts
await auth.api.viewBackupCodes({
    body: {
        userId: "user-id"
    }
})
```

### Trusted Devices

You can mark a device as trusted by passing `trustDevice` to `verifyTotp` or `verifyOtp`.

```ts
const verify2FA = async (code: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp({
        code,
        callbackURL: "/dashboard",
        trustDevice: true // Mark this device as trusted
    })
    if (data) {
        // 2FA verified and device trusted
    }
}
```

When `trustDevice` is set to `true`, the current device will be remembered for 60 days. During this period, the user won't be prompted for 2FA on subsequent sign-ins from this device. The trust period is refreshed each time the user signs in successfully.


## Schema

The plugin requires 1 additional fields in the `user` table and 1 additional table to store the two factor authentication data.

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "twoFactorEnabled", type: "boolean", description: "Whether two factor authentication is enabled for the user.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>

Table: `twoFactor`

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "secret", type: "string", description: "The secret used to generate the TOTP code.", isOptional: true },
        { name: "backupCodes", type: "string", description: "The backup codes used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>

## Options

### Server

**twoFactorTable**: The name of the table that stores the two factor authentication data. Default: `twoFactor`.

**skipVerificationOnEnable**: Skip the verification process before enabling two factor for a user.

**Issuer**: The issuer is the name of your application. It's used to generate TOTP codes. It'll be displayed in the authenticator apps.

**TOTP options**

these are options for TOTP.

<TypeTable

### Client

To use the two factor plugin in the client, you need to add it on your plugins list.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        twoFactorClient({ // [!code highlight]
            twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ]
})
```


**Options**

`twoFactorPage`: The page to redirect the user to after they have enabled 2-Factor. This is the page where the user will be redirected to verify their 2-Factor code.

`redirect`: If set to `false`, the user will not be redirected to the `twoFactorPage` after they have enabled 2-Factor.
