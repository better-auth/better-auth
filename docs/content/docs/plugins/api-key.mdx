The username plugin wraps the email and password authenticator and adds username support. This allows users to sign in and sign up with their username instead of their email.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { apiKey } from "better-auth/plugins"

        const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                apiKey() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { apiKeyClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                apiKeyClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Getting information on an API key

You can pass an API key ID to the `apiKey.get` function to get information on the API key including the key itself.

If an API key was created without an owner, then you cannot get it's information as it requires authorization to get the information.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.apiKey.get({
  query: {
    keyId: myApiKeyID,
  },
});
```

### Signin with username

To signin a user with username, you can use the `signIn.username` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `username`: The username of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.signIn.username({
  username: "test",
  password: "password1234",
});
```

### Update username

To update the username of a user, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.updateUser({
  username: "new-username",
});
```
