The organization plugin provides a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system for managing permissions.

## Default Roles

The plugin comes with three built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `owner` | Full access to all organization features |
| `admin` | Can manage members, invitations, and settings |
| `member` | Basic access to organization resources |

## Custom Roles

Define custom roles with specific permissions:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        organization({
            roles: {
                owner: {
                    permissions: ["*"] // All permissions
                },
                admin: {
                    permissions: [
                        "member:read",
                        "member:write",
                        "invitation:read",
                        "invitation:write",
                        "organization:read",
                        "organization:update"
                    ]
                },
                member: {
                    permissions: [
                        "member:read",
                        "organization:read"
                    ]
                },
                viewer: {
                    permissions: [
                        "organization:read"
                    ]
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

## Checking Permissions

Check if the current user has a specific permission:

```ts
const hasPermission = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    organizationId: "org_123",
    permission: "member:write"
})

if (hasPermission) {
    // User can manage members
}
```

## Permission Format

Permissions follow the `resource:action` format:

- `organization:read` - View organization details
- `organization:update` - Update organization settings
- `organization:delete` - Delete the organization
- `member:read` - View member list
- `member:write` - Add/remove members
- `invitation:read` - View invitations
- `invitation:write` - Create/cancel invitations
