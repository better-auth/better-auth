The invitation system allows organization admins to invite new members via email
or shareable links.

## Invitation Schema

The invitation table includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `organizationId` | string | Organization reference |
| `email` | string | Invitee's email |
| `role` | string | Role to assign on acceptance |
| `status` | string | pending, accepted, rejected, expired |
| `inviterId` | string | User who sent the invitation |
| `expiresAt` | Date | Expiration timestamp |
| `createdAt` | Date | Creation timestamp |

## Email Configuration

To send invitation emails, configure the email provider in your auth config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        organization({
            sendInvitationEmail: async ({ email, organization, invitationLink }) => {
                // Send email using your email provider
                await sendEmail({
                    to: email,
                    subject: `You've been invited to ${organization.name}`,
                    html: `<a href="${invitationLink}">Accept invitation</a>`
                })
            }
        })
    ]
})
```
