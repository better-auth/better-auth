Organizations are the top-level entity in the organization plugin. They represent a group of users working together.

## Creating an Organization

To create a new organization, use the `organization.create` method:

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/create"
    method="POST"
    requireSession
    note="Includes any additional fields from the organization schema.">
```ts
type createOrganization = {
    /**
     * Name of the organization.
     */
    name: string = "My Organization"
    /**
     * Slug of the organization. Not required if slugs are disabled.
     */
    slug: string = "my-org"
    /**
     * Organization logo.
     */
    logo?: string = "https://example.com/logo.png"
    /**
     * Organization metadata.
     */
    metadata?: Record<string, any> = { test: "organization-metadata" }
    /**
     * Whether to keep the current active organization active after creating a new one.
     */
    keepCurrentActiveOrganization?: boolean = true
    /**
     * User ID of the organization creator, allows you provide the user id when calling the endpoint without session headers.
     * @serverOnly
     */
    userId?: string = "user-id"
}
```
</APIMethod> 

### Creating an org as an admin

You can create organizations on behalf another user by providing the `userId` parameter.
This is only available on the `auth.api.createOrganization` method.

```ts
await auth.api.createOrganization({
    body: {
        name: "My Organization",
        slug: "my-org",
        userId: "user-id-who-will-be-the-owner", // [!code highlight]
    },
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Note that the `userId` parameter cannot be used alongside session headers.
    If headers were provided, it will take precedence over the `userId` parameter.
</Callout>


## Updating an Organization

You can update an organization by calling the `organization.update` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/update"
    method="POST"
    requireSession
    note="Includes any additional fields from the organization schema.">
```ts
type updateOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to update.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * The data to update the organization with.
     */
    data: {
        /**
         * The name of the organization.
         */
        name?: string = "Updated Organization Name"
        /**
         * The logo of the organization.
         */
        logo?: string = "https://example.com/logo.png"
        /**
         * The slug of the organization.
         */
        slug?: string = "updated-slug"
        /**
         * The metadata of the organization.
         */
        metadata?: Record<string, any> = { test: "organization-metadata" }
    }
}
```
</APIMethod>


## Deleting an Organization

You can delete an organization using the `organization.delete` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/delete"
    method="POST"
    requireSession
    note="Requires owner or admin permissions.">
```ts
type deleteOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to delete.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout type="warn">
    Deleting an organization will also delete all associated members,
    invitations, and related data.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    You can disable organization deletion entirely by setting `disableOrganizationDeletion: true` in the plugin options.
</Callout>


## Check if org slug is taken

You can check if an organization slug is taken using the `organization.checkSlug` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/check-slug"
    method="POST"
    requireSession
>
```ts
type checkSlug = {
    /**
     * The slug to check.
     */
    slug: string = "my-org"
}
```
</APIMethod>

Returns:
```ts
type Result = { isTaken: boolean }
```

## Organization Related Options

You can configure the organization plugin with the following options:

### `allowUserToCreateOrganization`

Controls whether users can create organizations. Can be a boolean or a function that receives the user and returns a boolean.

```ts
organization({
    allowUserToCreateOrganization: async (user) => {
        return user.plan === "pro";
    }
})
```

**Default:** `true`

### `organizationLimit`

The maximum number of organizations a user can create. Can be a number or a function that receives the user and returns a number.

```ts
organization({
    organizationLimit: async (user) => {
        return user.plan === "pro" ? 10 : 5;
    }
})
```

**Default:** `100`

### `creatorRole`

The role that is assigned to the creator of the organization.

```ts
organization({
    creatorRole: "owner"
})
```

**Default:** `"owner"`

### `membershipLimit`

The maximum number of members allowed in an organization.

```ts
organization({
    membershipLimit: 100
})
```

**Default:** `100`

### `disableSlugs`

Whether to disable slugs for organizations. When disabled, organizations will only be identified by their ID.

<Callout type="warn">
    Don't forget to re-run schema generation or migrations after changing this option.
</Callout>

```ts
organization({
    disableSlugs: true
})
```

**Default:** `false`

### `defaultOrganizationIdField`

Controls the input & output of organization identifiers. If you set this to `slug`,
any endpoint parameters for `organizationId` will accept the organization's `slug` instead of its `id`, and vice versa.

This is useful if your client side organization state only knows the organization's `slug`, and not its `id`.
(E.g., via a query parameter or url parameter)

Learn more about [Organization Identifiers](/docs/plugins/organization-new/organization-identifiers).

```ts
organization({
    defaultOrganizationIdField: "slug" // "slug" or "id"
})
```

**Default:** `"id"`

### `disableOrganizationDeletion`

Prevents organizations from being deleted.

```ts
organization({
    disableOrganizationDeletion: true
})
```

**Default:** `false`

### `roles`

Define additional roles for the organization plugin beyond the default `owner`, `admin`, and `member` roles.

```ts
organization({
    roles: {
        moderator: {
            // role permissions
        }
    }
})
```

### `ac`

Configure access control for the organization plugin. See the [Access Control](/docs/plugins/organization-new/access-control) documentation for more details.

### `hooks`

Hooks allow you to run custom logic at various points in the organization lifecycle. See the [Hooks](/docs/plugins/organization-new/hooks) documentation for more details.

### `schema`

Customize the database schema for organization-related tables. You can rename fields, change model names, or add additional fields.

```ts
organization({
    schema: {
        organization: {
            modelName: "teams", // rename the table
            fields: {
                name: "teamName" // rename fields
            },
            additionalFields: {
                billingId: {
                    type: "string",
                    required: false
                }
            }
        },
        member: {
            additionalFields: {
                department: {
                    type: "string",
                    required: false
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```
