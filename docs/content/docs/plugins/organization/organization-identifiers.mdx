title: Organization Identifiers
description: Learn about the different identifiers you can use to identify an organization.
---

By default, the organization plugin uses the organization `id` to identify organizations in API calls.
However, some applications prefer to use the organization `slug` instead, which is especially useful when the slug is already available
in client-side state or URL parameters.

## Configuring the Default Identifier

You can configure which field is used as the default organization identifier:

```ts title="auth.ts"
organization({
  defaultOrganizationIdField: "slug", // "slug" or "id" (default is "id")
});
```

Once configured, any endpoint that accepts an `organizationId` parameter will expect the configured field type:

```ts
await authClient.organization.update({
  organizationId: "my-org-slug", // Pass the slug instead of the ID
  data: {
    name: "New Name",
  },
});
```

## Automatic Organization Resolution

To avoid passing `organizationId` to every API call, you can configure `getActiveOrg` on the client
to automatically resolve the active organization.

### Custom Function

Provide a function that returns the current organization identifier:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      getActiveOrg: () => {
        // Return the org `id` or `slug` based on your `defaultOrganizationIdField` config
        return "my-org-slug";
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

With this configured, the `organizationId` parameter becomes optional in most API calls.

### Built-in Helpers

The plugin provides built-in helpers to extract the organization identifier from the URL.

**From query parameters** (e.g., `?org=my-org-slug`):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      getActiveOrg: "query", // [!code focus]
    }),
  ],
});
```

**From path segments** (e.g., `/dashboard/my-org-slug/settings`):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      getActiveOrg: "path:1", // [!code focus]
      // The number indicates the path segment index (0-based)
      // For "/dashboard/my-org-slug/settings", index 1 = "my-org-slug"
    }),
  ],
});
```

**From cookies** (e.g., `active_organization=my-org-slug`):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      getActiveOrg: "cookie", // [!code focus]
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Callout type="info">
    When using `"cookie"`, the plugin reads from the `active_organization` cookie.
    This enables cross-tab synchronization - all tabs in the same browser will share the active organization.
