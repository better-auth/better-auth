Members are users who belong to an organization.
Each member has a role that determines their permissions within the organization.

## Adding a Member

You can add a user directly to an organization using the `organization.addMember` method.
This is useful for server-side operations where you want to add a member without sending an invitation.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/add-member"
    method="POST"
    note="This is a server-only API. Use invitations for client-side member additions.">
```ts
type addMember = {
    /**
     * The user ID of the user to add as a member.
     */
    userId: string = "user-id"
    /**
     * The role(s) to assign to the new member.
     * Can be a single role or an array of roles.
     */
    role: string | string[] = "member"
    /**
     * The organization ID to add the member to.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Adding a Member with Multiple Roles

You can assign multiple roles to a member:

```ts
await auth.api.addMember({
    body: {
        userId: "user-id",
        role: ["admin", "moderator"], // Multiple roles
        organizationId: "org-id",
    },
})
```

### Adding a Member with Additional Fields

If you have defined additional fields in the member schema, you can include them when adding a member:

```ts
await auth.api.addMember({
    body: {
        userId: "user-id",
        role: "member",
        organizationId: "org-id",
        department: "Engineering", // Custom additional field
    },
})
```

<Callout type="info">
    The `addMember` API is intended for server-side use only. For client-side 
    member additions, use the [invitation system](/docs/plugins/organization/invitations) instead.
</Callout>

## Removing a Member

You can remove a member from an organization using the `organization.removeMember` method.
The member can be identified by their member ID or email address.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/remove-member"
    method="POST">
```ts
type removeMember = {
    /**
     * The member ID or email address of the member to remove.
     */
    memberIdOrEmail: string = "member-id-or-email"
    /**
     * The organization ID to remove the member from.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout type="warn">
    The last owner of an organization cannot be removed. If you need to remove the owner,
    first assign the owner role to another member.
</Callout>

## Leaving an Organization

A member can leave an organization using the `organization.leave` method.
This is different from `removeMember` in that it allows a user to remove themselves from an organization.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/leave"
    method="POST">
```ts
type leaveOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to leave.
     */
    organizationId: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout type="warn">
    The last owner of an organization cannot leave. If you need to leave as the only owner,
    first assign the owner role to another member.
</Callout>

## Updating a Member's Role

You can update a member's role using the `organization.updateMemberRole` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/update-member-role"
    method="POST">
```ts
type updateMemberRole = {
    /**
     * The new role(s) to assign to the member.
     * Can be a single role or an array of roles.
     */
    role: string | string[] = "admin"
    /**
     * The member ID to update.
     */
    memberId: string = "member-id"
    /**
     * The organization ID. If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Updating to Multiple Roles

You can assign multiple roles to a member:

```ts
await auth.api.updateMemberRole({
    headers,
    body: {
        memberId: "member-id",
        role: ["admin", "moderator"], // Multiple roles
        organizationId: "org-id",
    },
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
    The last owner of an organization cannot have their owner role removed. 
    If you need to change the owner's role, first assign the owner role to another member.
</Callout>

## Getting the Active Member

You can get the current user's member details for the active organization using the `organization.getActiveMember` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/get-active-member"
    method="GET">
```ts
type getActiveMember = {
    // No parameters required
    // Uses the session's active organization
}
```
</APIMethod>


Returns:

```ts
type Member = {
    id: string
    userId: string
    organizationId: string
    role: string
}
```

## Listing Members

List all members of an organization with pagination, sorting, and filtering support.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/list-members"
    method="GET">
```ts
type listMembers = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to list members for.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * The organization slug to list members for.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationSlug?: string = "org-slug"
    /**
     * Maximum number of members to return.
     */
    limit?: number = 10
    /**
     * Number of members to skip for pagination.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
    /**
     * Field to sort by (e.g., "createdAt", "role").
     */
    sortBy?: string = "createdAt"
    /**
     * Sort direction.
     */
    sortDirection?: "asc" | "desc" = "asc"
    /**
     * Field to filter by.
     */
    filterField?: string = "role"
    /**
     * Value to filter by.
     */
    filterValue?: string | number | boolean = "admin"
    /**
     * Filter operator.
     */
    filterOperator?: "eq" | "ne" | "lt" | "lte" | "gt" | "gte" | "contains" = "eq"
}
```
</APIMethod>

Returns:

```ts
type ListMembersResponse = {
    members: Array<{
        id: string
        userId: string
        organizationId: string
        role: string
        createdAt: Date
        user: {
            id: string
            name: string
            email: string
            image: string | null
        }
    }>
    total: number
    limit: number | null
    offset: number | null
}
```

## Configuration Options

### `membershipLimit`

The maximum number of members allowed in an organization. Can be a number or an async function.

```ts
// Static limit
organization({
    membershipLimit: 50
})

// Dynamic limit based on organization
organization({
    membershipLimit: async (user, organization, ctx) => {
        // Premium orgs get more members
        if (organization.metadata?.plan === "premium") {
            return 500
        }
        return 50
    }
})
```

**Default:** `100`

## Member Schema

The member table includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `organizationId` | string | Organization reference |
| `userId` | string | User reference |
| `role` | string | Member's role |
| `createdAt` | Date | When the member joined |

## Default Roles

The plugin comes with three default roles:

- **owner**: Full access, can delete organization and manage all settings
- **admin**: Can manage members, invitations, and most settings
- **member**: Basic access to organization resources

See [Roles & Permissions](/docs/plugins/organization-new/roles-permissions) for customizing roles.
