Members are users who belong to an organization.
Each member has a role that determines their permissions within the organization.

## Adding a Member

You can add a user directly to an organization using the `organization.addMember` method.
This is useful for server-side operations where you want to add a member without sending an invitation.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/add-member"
    method="POST"
    note="This is a server-only API. Use invitations for client-side member additions.">
```ts
type addMember = {
    /**
     * The user ID of the user to add as a member.
     */
    userId: string = "user-id"
    /**
     * The role(s) to assign to the new member.
     * Can be a single role or an array of roles.
     */
    role: string | string[] = "member"
    /**
     * The organization ID to add the member to.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Adding a Member with Multiple Roles

You can assign multiple roles to a member:

```ts
await auth.api.addMember({
    body: {
        userId: "user-id",
        role: ["admin", "moderator"], // Multiple roles
        organizationId: "org-id",
    },
})
```

### Adding a Member with Additional Fields

If you have defined additional fields in the member schema, you can include them when adding a member:

```ts
await auth.api.addMember({
    body: {
        userId: "user-id",
        role: "member",
        organizationId: "org-id",
        department: "Engineering", // Custom additional field
    },
})
```

<Callout type="info">
    The `addMember` API is intended for server-side use only. For client-side 
    member additions, use the [invitation system](/docs/plugins/organization/invitations) instead.
</Callout>

## Removing a Member

You can remove a member from an organization using the `organization.removeMember` method.
The member can be identified by their member ID or email address.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/remove-member"
    method="POST">
```ts
type removeMember = {
    /**
     * The member ID or email address of the member to remove.
     */
    memberIdOrEmail: string = "member-id-or-email"
    /**
     * The organization ID to remove the member from.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout type="warn">
    The last owner of an organization cannot be removed. If you need to remove the owner,
    first assign the owner role to another member.
</Callout>

## Configuration Options

### `membershipLimit`

The maximum number of members allowed in an organization. Can be a number or an async function.

```ts
// Static limit
organization({
    membershipLimit: 50
})

// Dynamic limit based on organization
organization({
    membershipLimit: async (user, organization, ctx) => {
        // Premium orgs get more members
        if (organization.metadata?.plan === "premium") {
            return 500
        }
        return 50
    }
})
```

**Default:** `100`

## Member Schema

The member table includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `organizationId` | string | Organization reference |
| `userId` | string | User reference |
| `role` | string | Member's role |
| `createdAt` | Date | When the member joined |

## Default Roles

The plugin comes with three default roles:

- **owner**: Full access, can delete organization and manage all settings
- **admin**: Can manage members, invitations, and most settings
- **member**: Basic access to organization resources

See [Roles & Permissions](/docs/plugins/organization-new/roles-permissions) for customizing roles.
