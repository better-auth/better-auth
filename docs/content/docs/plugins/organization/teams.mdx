Teams are a way to group members within an organization.

## Removing a Team

You can remove a team from an organization using the `organization.removeTeam` method.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/remove-team"
    method="POST"
    requireSession>
```ts
type removeTeam = {
    /**
     * The team ID of the team to remove.
     */
    teamId: string = "team-id"
    /**
     * The organization ID which the team falls under.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

Returns:

```ts
type Result = {
    message: "Team removed successfully."
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
    By default, the last team in an organization cannot be removed.
    To allow removing all teams, set `allowRemovingAllTeams: true` in the teams addon options.
</Callout>
