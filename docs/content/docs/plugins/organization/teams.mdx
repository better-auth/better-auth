Teams are a way to group members within an organization.

## Set Up 

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### 1. Add the teams addon
       To add the teams addon, simply add the `teams()` addon into the `organization()` plugin.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";
        import { teams } from "@better-auth/organization/addons"; // [!code highlight]

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                organization({
                    use: [teams()], // [!code highlight]
                }),
            ],
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### 2. Migrate the database
        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
                ```bash
                npx @better-auth/cli migrate
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
                ```bash
                npx @better-auth/cli generate
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You can now start utilizing team functionality in your application.

    name: string = "Engineering"
    /**
     * The organization ID which the team will belong to.
     * If not provided, uses the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * The slug of the team.
     * Only required if `enableSlugs` is set to true in the teams addon options.
     */
    slug?: string = "engineering"
}
```
</APIMethod>

</Callout>

## Updating a Team

You can update a team in an organization using the `organization.updateTeam` method.

<APIMethod

</Callout>

## Listing Teams

You can list all teams in an organization using the `organization.listTeams` method. This endpoint supports pagination and sorting.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/list-teams"
    method="GET"
    requireSession>
```ts
type listOrganizationTeams = {
    /**
     * The organization ID which the teams belong to.

     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * Maximum number of teams to return (1-100).
     */
    limit?: number = 10
    /**
     * Number of teams to skip for pagination.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
    /**
     * Field to sort by.
     * Options: "createdAt", "name", "updatedAt"
     */
    sortBy?: "createdAt" | "name" | "updatedAt" = "createdAt"

```
</APIMethod>

    teams: Array<{
        id: string;
        name: string;
        organizationId: string;
        createdAt: Date;

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
    You can limit the maximum number of members per team using the `maximumMembersPerTeam` option in the teams addon configuration.
</Callout>

    /**
     * The team whose members should be returned.
     * If not provided, uses the active team from the session.
     */
    teamId?: string = "team-id"
    /**
     * Maximum number of members to return (1-100).
     */
    limit?: number = 10
    /**
     * Number of members to skip for pagination.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
    /**
     * Field to sort by.
     * Options: "createdAt"
     */
    sortBy?: "createdAt" = "createdAt"

    The user must be a member of the team to list its members.
</Callout>

## Listing User Teams

You can list all teams that the current user is a member of using the `organization.listUserTeams` method. This returns teams across all organizations the user belongs to. This endpoint supports pagination.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/list-user-teams"
    method="GET"
    requireSession>
```ts
type listUserTeams = {
    /**
     * Maximum number of teams to return (1-100).
     */
    limit?: number = 10
    /**
     * Number of teams to skip for pagination.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
}
```
</APIMethod>

Returns a paginated result with teams and total count:

```ts
type Result = {
    teams: Array<{
        id: string;
        name: string;
        organizationId: string;
        createdAt: Date;
        updatedAt: Date;

    This endpoint returns teams from all organizations the user is a member of, not just the active organization.
</Callout>

## Setting the Active Team

You can set a team as the active team for the current session using the `organization.setActiveTeam` method. This stores the active team ID in the session, making it available for subsequent API calls.

<APIMethod
    path="/organization/set-active-team"
    method="POST"
    requireSession>
```ts
type setActiveTeam = {
    /**
     * The team ID to set as active.
     * Pass null to unset the active team.
     */
    teamId?: string | null = "team-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

Returns the team that was set as active, or `null` if the active team was unset:

```ts
type Result = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    organizationId: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    // Additional fields if configured in schema
} | null
```

<Callout type="info">
    The user must be a member of the team to set it as active. An active organization must also be set before setting an active team.
</Callout>
