description: Manage organization members and their roles.
---

Members are users who belong to an organization. Each member has a role that determines their permissions within the organization.

## Listing Members

Get all members of an organization:

```ts
const { data: members } = await authClient.organization.listMembers({
    organizationId: "org_123"
})
```

## Adding Members

Add a user directly to an organization:

```ts
await authClient.organization.addMember({
    organizationId: "org_123",
    userId: "user_456",
    role: "member" // or "admin", "owner", or custom role
})
```

## Updating Member Role

Change a member's role:

```ts
await authClient.organization.updateMemberRole({
    organizationId: "org_123",
    memberId: "member_789",
    role: "admin"
})
```

## Removing Members

Remove a member from an organization:

```ts
await authClient.organization.removeMember({
    organizationId: "org_123",
    memberId: "member_789"
})
```

<Callout type="info">
Organization owners cannot be removed. Transfer ownership first if you need to remove the owner.
</Callout>

## Checking Membership

Check if the current user is a member of an organization:

```ts
const isMember = await authClient.organization.checkMembership({
    organizationId: "org_123"
})
```

## Member Schema

The member table includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `organizationId` | string | Organization reference |
| `userId` | string | User reference |
| `role` | string | Member's role |
| `createdAt` | Date | When the member joined |

## Default Roles

The plugin comes with three default roles:

- **owner**: Full access, can delete organization and manage all settings
- **admin**: Can manage members, invitations, and most settings
- **member**: Basic access to organization resources

See [Roles & Permissions](/docs/plugins/organization-new/roles-permissions) for customizing roles.
