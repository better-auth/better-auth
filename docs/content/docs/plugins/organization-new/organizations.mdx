Organizations are the top-level entity in the organization plugin. They represent a group of users working together.

## Creating an Organization

To create a new organization, use the `organization.create` method:

```ts
const org = await authClient.organization.create({
    name: "My Organization",
    slug: "my-org", // optional, auto-generated if not provided
})
```

## Listing Organizations

Get all organizations for the current user:

```ts
const { data: organizations } = await authClient.organization.list()
```

## Getting an Organization

Retrieve a specific organization by ID or slug:

```ts
// By ID
const org = await authClient.organization.getById({
    organizationId: "org_123"
})

// By slug
const org = await authClient.organization.getBySlug({
    slug: "my-org"
})
```

## Updating an Organization

Update organization details:

```ts
await authClient.organization.update({
    organizationId: "org_123",
    data: {
        name: "Updated Organization Name",
        logo: "https://example.com/logo.png"
    }
})
```

## Deleting an Organization

Delete an organization (requires owner or admin permissions):

```ts
await authClient.organization.delete({
    organizationId: "org_123"
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
Deleting an organization will also delete all associated members, invitations, and related data.
</Callout>

## Setting Active Organization

Set the active organization for the current session:

```ts
await authClient.organization.setActive({
    organizationId: "org_123"
})
```
