description: Anonymous plugin for Better Auth.
---

The Anonymous plugin allows users to have an authenticated experience without requiring them to provide an email address, password, OAuth provider, or any other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Users can later link an authentication method to their account when ready.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To enable anonymous authentication, add the anonymous plugin to your authentication configuration.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { anonymous } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            anonymous() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Migrate your database

    Run the migration command to create the necessary tables in your database.

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth migrate # [!code highlight]
    ```

    Alternatively, you can generate the required tables with:

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth generate
    ```

    Refer to the [Schema section](#schema) to see which fields this plugin requires. You can also manually add these fields to your database if necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Next, include the anonymous client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { anonymousClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    const client = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            anonymousClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In

To sign in a user anonymously, use the `signIn.anonymous()` method.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await client.signIn.anonymous()
```

### Link Account

Once the user is signed in, you can link an account to their anonymous profile. Currently, only email/password linking is supported.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await client.anonymous.linkAccount({
    email: "user@email.com",
    password: "secure-password"
})
```

## Options

- `emailDomainName`: The domain name to use when generating an email address for anonymous users. Defaults to the domain name of the current site.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        anonymous({
            emailDomainName: "example.com"
        })
    ]
})
```


## Schema

The anonymous plugin requires an additional field in the user table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "isAnonymous", type: "boolean", description: "Indicates whether the user is anonymous.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>
