## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To enable anonymous authentication, add the anonymous plugin to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { emailOTP } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            emailOTP({ // [!code highlight]
                    async sendVerificationOTP({ email, otp, type}) { // [!code highlight]
						// Implement the sendVerificationOTP method to send the OTP to the user's email address // [!code highlight]
					}, // [!code highlight]
            }) // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    ```ts title="client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { emailOTPClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    const client = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            emailOTPClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Send OTP

Before signing in or verifying email, you need to send an OTP to the user's email address.

```ts title="example.ts"
await authClient.emailOtp.sendVerificationOtp({
    email: "user-email@email.com",
    type: "sign-in" // or "email-verification"
})
```

### SignIn with OTP

Once the user provides the OTP, you can sign in the user using the `signIn.emailOTP()` method.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await authClient.signIn.emailOtp({
    email: "user-email@email.com",
    otp: "123456"
})
```

### Verify Email

To verify the user's email address, use the `verifyEmail()` method.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await authClient.emailOtp.verifyEmail({
    email: "user-email@email.com",
    otp: "123456"
})
```

## Options

- `sendVerificationOTP`: A function that sends the OTP to the user's email address. The function receives an object with the following properties:
  - `email`: The user's email address.
  - `otp`: The OTP to send.
  - `type`: The type of OTP to send. Can be either "sign-in" or "email-verification".

### Example

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        emailOTP({
            async sendVerificationOTP({
                email,
                otp,
                type
            }) {
                if(type === "sign-in") {
                    // Send the OTP for sign-in
                } else {
                    // Send the OTP for email verification
                }
            },
        })
    ]
})
```

- `otpLength`: The length of the OTP. Defaults to 6.
- `otpExpiry`: The expiry time of the OTP in seconds. Defaults to 300 seconds.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        emailOTP({
            otpLength: 8,
            otpExpiry: 600
        })
    ]
