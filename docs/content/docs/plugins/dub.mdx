## Usage

### Lead Tracking

By default, the plugin will track sign up events as leads. You can disable this by setting `disableLeadTracking` to `true`.

```ts
import { dubAnalytics } from "@dub/better-auth";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Dub } from "dub";

const dub = new Dub();

const betterAuth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    dubAnalytics({
      dubClient: dub,
      disableLeadTracking: true, // Disable lead tracking
    }),
  ],
});
```

### OAuth Linking

The plugin supports OAuth for account linking.

First, you need to setup OAuth app in Dub. Dub supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is recommended if you build integrations extending Dubâ€™s functionality [Learn more about OAuth](https://dub.co/docs/integrations/quickstart#integrating-via-oauth-2-0-recommended).

Once you get the client ID and client secret, you can configure the plugin.

```ts
dubAnalytics({
  dubClient: dub,
  oauth: {
    clientId: "your-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
  },
});
```

And in the client, you need to use the `dubAnalyticsClient` plugin.

```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { dubAnalyticsClient } from "@dub/better-auth/client";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [dubAnalyticsClient()],
});
```

To link account with Dub, you need to use the `dub.link`.

```ts
const response = await authClient.dub.link({
  callbackURL: "/dashboard", // URL to redirect to after linking
});
```
