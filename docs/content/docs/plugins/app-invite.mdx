The App Invite plugin allows inviting other users to your application and sign them up.  
You can create either personal or public invitations. Personal invitations are restricted to a specific email address while public invitations allow multiple users to sign up via a single invitation.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To use the App Invite plugin, add it to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { appInvite } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            appInvite({ // [!code highlight]
                // required for personal invites // [!code highlight]
                sendInvitationEmail: (data) => { // [!code highlight]
                    // ... send invitation to the user // [!code highlight]
                } // [!code highlight]
            }) // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Include the App Invite client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { appInviteClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins" // [!code highlight]

    const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            appInviteClient() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

To add members to the application, we first need to send an invitation to the user. The user will receive an email/sms with the invitation link. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be signed up to the application.

### Setup Invitation Email

For personal invites to work we first need to provide `sendInvitationEmail` to the `better-auth` instance. This function is responsible for sending the invitation email to the user.

You'll need to construct and send the invitation link to the user. The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used with the acceptInvitation function when the user clicks on it.

This is only required for personal invites. Sharing public invitations is up to the inviter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { appInvite } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { sendAppInvitation } from "./email";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    appInvite({
      async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        const inviteLink = `https://example.com/accept-invitation/${data.id}`;
        sendAppInvitation({
          email: data.email,
          invitedByUsername: data.inviter.name,
          invitedByEmail: data.inviter.email,
          inviteLink,
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Send Invitation

To invite users to the app, you can use the `invite` function provided by the client.
the `invite` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user to invite. Leave empty to create a public invitation.

- `resend`: A boolean value that determines whether to resend the invitation email, if the user is already invited. Defaults to `false`

- `domainWhitelist`: An optional comma separated list of domains that allows public invitations to be accepted only from approved domains.

```ts title="invitation.ts"
await authClient.inviteUser({
  email: "test@email.com",
});
```

### Accept Invitation

When a user receives an invitation email, they can click on the invitation link to accept the invitation. The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used to accept the invitation.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.acceptInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "test@email.com", // must be set for personal invites
  password: "password123456",
  // ... additional user data
});
```

### Update Invitation Status

To update the status of invitations you can use the `acceptInvitation`, `rejectInvitation`, `cancelInvitation` function provided by the client. The functions take the invitation id as an argument.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
// cancel invitation (by default only the inviter can cancel invitations)
await authClient.cancelInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
});

// reject invitation (this is only available for personal invites)
await authClient.rejectInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
});
```

### Get Invitation

To get an invitation you can use the `getAppInvitation` function provided by the client. You need to provide the invitation id as a query parameter.

```ts title="auth-client"
await authClient.getAppInvitation({
  query: {
    id: params.id,
  },
});
```

## Schema

The plugin requires an additional table in the database.

Table Name: `app_invitation`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each invitation",
      isPrimaryKey: true,
    },
    {
      name: "email",
      type: "string",
      description: "The email address of the user",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "inviterId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the inviter",
      isForeignKey: true,
    },
    {
      name: "status",
      type: "string",
      description: "The status of the invitation",
    },
    {
      name: "domainWhitelist",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "A comma separated whitelist of domains for a public invitation",
    },
    {
      name: "expiresAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the invitation expires",
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the invitation was created",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Options

**allowUserToCreateInvitation**: `boolean` | `((user: User, type: "personal" | "public") => Promise<boolean> | boolean)` - A function that determines whether a user can create invite others. By defaults it's `true`. You can set it to `false` to restrict users from creating invitations.

**allowUserToCancelInvitation**: `(data: { user: User, invitation: AppInvitation }) => Promise<boolean> | boolean` - A functon that determines whether a user can cancel inivtations. By default the user can only cancel invites created by them. You can set it to `false` to restrict users from canceling invitations.

**invitationExpiresIn**: `number` - How long the invitation link is valid for in seconds. By default, it's 48 hours (2 days).

**sendInvitationEmail**: `async (data) => Promise<void>` - A function that sends an invitation email to the user. This is only required for personal invitations.

**autoSignIn**: A boolean value that determines whether to prevent automatic sign-up when accepting an invitation. Defaults to `false`.
