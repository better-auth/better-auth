description: Vercel BotID plugin for Better Auth.
---

The Vercel BotID is a security feature built into the Vercel platform that protects your web applications from sophisticated
bots and automated abuse. It's designed to be frictionless for both developers and end users,
acting as an invisible CAPTCHA that doesn't interrupt the user experience.

You can read more about it in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/botid#get-started-with-botid).
