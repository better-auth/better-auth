description: Vercel BotID plugin for Better Auth.
---

The Vercel BotID is a security feature built into the Vercel platform that protects your web applications from sophisticated
bots and automated abuse. It's designed to be frictionless for both developers and end users,
acting as an invisible CAPTCHA that doesn't interrupt the user experience.

You can read more about it in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/botid#get-started-with-botid).

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Below is a list of possible configuration options for the plugin.

### `endpoints`

The endpoints to check for bots. By default the plugin will check all endpoints.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        botId({
            endpoints: ["/sign-up/*", "/sign-in/*"] // or "all" for all endpoints // [!code highlight]
        })
    ]
})
```

### `validateRequest`

A custom function to validate the request, this will override the default validation.


```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        botId({
            validateRequest: ({request, verification}) => { // [!code highlight]
                return !verification.isBot; // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
        })
    ]
})
```

<Callout>
    This function will not be called if the request path doesn't match the `endpoints` option.
</Callout>


### `disable`

Whether to disable Vercel BotID. By default the plugin is enabled.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        botId({
            disable: true // [!code highlight]
        })
    ]
})
```

### `checkBotIdOptions`

The options to pass to the `checkBotId` function from the Vercel BotID library.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        botId({
            checkBotIdOptions: {
                developmentOptions: {
                    bypass: "BAD-BOT"
                }
            }
        })
