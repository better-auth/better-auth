The username plugin wraps the email and password authenticator and adds username support. This allows users to sign in and sign up with their username instead of their email.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

        const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                username() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration to add the required fields to the user table.

        This will add the following fields to the **user** table:

        - `username`: The username of the user.

        ```bash
        npx better-auth migrate
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin
        
        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        
        const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                usernameClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Signup with username

To signup a user with username, you can use the `signUp.username` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `username`: The username of the user.
- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 32 by default. 
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user. (optional)
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed up. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        usernameClient() // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
// ---cut---

const data = await client.signUp.username({
    username: "test",
    email: "test@email.com",
    password: "password1234",
    name: "test",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png",
})
```

### Signin with username

To signin a user with username, you can use the `signIn.username` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `username`: The username of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed in. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        usernameClient() // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
// ---cut---

const data = await client.signIn.username({
    username: "test",
    password: "password1234",
})
```

## Schema

The plugin requires 1 field to be added to the user table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
            name: "username", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "The username of the user",
            isUnique: true
        },
    ]}
/>

## Options

The username plugin doesn't require any configuration. It just needs to be added to the server and client.
