title: OIDC Provider
description: Open ID Connect plugin for Better Auth that allows you to have your own OIDC provider.
---

The **OIDC Provider Plugin** enables you to build and manage your own OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, granting full control over user authentication without relying on third-party services like Okta or Azure AD. It also allows other services to authenticate users through your OIDC provider.

**Key Features**:

- **Client Registration**: Register clients to authenticate with your OIDC provider.
- **Dynamic Client Registration**: Allow clients to register dynamically.
- **Trusted Clients**: Configure hard-coded trusted clients with optional consent bypass.
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Support the Authorization Code Flow.
- **Public Clients**: Support public clients for SPA, mobile apps, CLI tools, etc.
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Publish a JWKS endpoint to allow clients to verify tokens. (Not fully implemented)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Issue refresh tokens and handle access token renewal using the `refresh_token` grant.
- **OAuth Consent**: Implement OAuth consent screens for user authorization, with an option to bypass consent for trusted applications.
- **UserInfo Endpoint**: Provide a UserInfo endpoint for clients to retrieve user details.

        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

        const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [oidcProvider({
                loginPage: "/sign-in", // path to the login page
                // ...other options
            })]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Migrate the Database

        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add the Client Plugin

        Add the OIDC client plugin to your auth client config.

        ```ts
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
        import { oidcClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [oidcClient({
                // Your OIDC configuration
            })]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Once installed, you can utilize the OIDC Provider to manage authentication flows within your application.

### Register a New Client

To register a new OIDC client, use the `oauth2.register` method.


#### Simple Example

```ts
const application = await client.oauth2.register({
    client_name: "My Client",
    redirect_uris: ["https://client.example.com/callback"],
});
```


#### Full Method


<APIMethod path="/oauth2/register" method="POST">
```ts
type registerOAuthApplication = {
    /**
     * A list of redirect URIs. 
     */
    redirect_uris: string[] = ["https://client.example.com/callback"]
    /**
     * The authentication method for the token endpoint. 
     */
    token_endpoint_auth_method?: "none" | "client_secret_basic" | "client_secret_post" = "client_secret_basic"
    /**
     * The grant types supported by the application. 
     */
    grant_types?: ("authorization_code" | "implicit" | "password" | "client_credentials" | "refresh_token" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer")[] = ["authorization_code"]
    /**
     * The response types supported by the application. 
     */
    response_types?: ("code" | "token")[] = ["code"]
    /**
     * The name of the application. 
     */
    client_name?: string = "My App"

This Endpoint support [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) compliant client registration.
  
### Trusted Clients

For first-party applications and internal services, you can configure trusted clients directly in your OIDC provider configuration. Trusted clients bypass database lookups for better performance and can optionally skip consent screens for improved user experience.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in",
        trustedClients: [
            {
                clientId: "internal-dashboard",
                clientSecret: "secure-secret-here",
                name: "Internal Dashboard",
                type: "web",
                redirectURLs: ["https://dashboard.company.com/auth/callback"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: true, // Skip consent for this trusted client
                metadata: { internal: true }
            },
            {
                clientId: "mobile-app",
                clientSecret: "mobile-secret", 
                name: "Company Mobile App",
                type: "native",
                redirectURLs: ["com.company.app://auth"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: false, // Still require consent if needed
                metadata: {}
            }
        ]
    })]
})
```

### UserInfo Endpoint

The OIDC Provider includes a UserInfo endpoint that allows clients to retrieve information about the authenticated user. This endpoint is available at `/oauth2/userinfo` and requires a valid access token.

<Endpoint path="/oauth2/userinfo" method="GET" />

```ts title="client-app.ts"
// Example of how a client would use the UserInfo endpoint
const response = await fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/auth/oauth2/userinfo', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
  }
});

const userInfo = await response.json();
// userInfo contains user details based on the scopes granted
```

The UserInfo endpoint returns different claims based on the scopes that were granted during authorization:

- With `openid` scope: Returns the user's ID (`sub` claim)
- With `profile` scope: Returns name, picture, given_name, family_name
- With `email` scope: Returns email and email_verified

The `getAdditionalUserInfoClaim` function receives the user object and the requested scopes array, allowing you to conditionally include claims based on the scopes granted during authorization. These additional claims will be included in both the UserInfo endpoint response and the ID token.

### Consent Screen

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, they may be prompted to authorize the application to access their data. This is known as the consent screen. By default, Better Auth will display a sample consent screen. You can customize the consent screen by providing a `consentPage` option during initialization.

**Note**: Trusted clients with `skipConsent: true` will bypass the consent screen entirely, providing a seamless experience for first-party applications.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        consentPage: "/path/to/consent/page"
    })]
})
```

The plugin will redirect the user to the specified path with a `client_id` and `scope` query parameter. You can use this information to display a custom consent screen. Once the user consents, you can call `oauth2.consent` to complete the authorization.

<Endpoint path="/oauth2/consent" method="POST" />

```ts title="server.ts"
const res = await client.oauth2.consent({
	accept: true, // or false to deny
});
```

The `client_id` and other necessary information are stored in the browser cookie, so you don't need to pass them in the request. If they don't exist in the cookie, the consent method will return an error.

### Handling Login

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, if they are not already logged in, they will be redirected to the login page. You can customize the login page by providing a `loginPage` option during initialization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in"
    })]
})
```

You don't need to handle anything from your side; when a new session is created, the plugin will handle continuing the authorization flow.

## Configuration

### OIDC Metadata

Customize the OIDC metadata by providing a configuration object during initialization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        metadata: {
            issuer: "https://your-domain.com",
            authorization_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/authorize",
            token_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/token",
            // ...other custom metadata
        }
    })]
})
```

### JWKS Endpoint

The OIDC Provider plugin can integrate with the JWT plugin to provide proper asymmetric key signing for ID tokens. When enabled, ID tokens will be signed using RSA/EdDSA keys and can be verified using the JWKS endpoint.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { jwt } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        jwt(), // Make sure to add the JWT plugin
        oidcProvider({
            useJWTPlugin: true, // Enable JWT plugin integration
            loginPage: "/sign-in",
            // ... other options
        })
    ]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
When `useJWTPlugin: false` (default), ID tokens are signed with the application secret.
</Callout>

### Dynamic Client Registration

If you want to allow clients to register dynamically, you can enable this feature by setting the `allowDynamicClientRegistration` option to `true`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        allowDynamicClientRegistration: true,
    })]
})
```

This will allow clients to register using the `/register` endpoint to be publicly available.

## Schema

The OIDC Provider plugin adds the following tables to the database:
