description: The organization plugin allows you to manage your organization's members and teams.
---

Organizations simplifies user access and permissions management. Assign roles and permissions to streamline project management, team coordination, and partnerships.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the plugin to your **auth** config
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        organization() // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Migrate the database

    Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

    <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
        <Tab value="migrate">
        ```bash
        npx @better-auth/cli migrate
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="generate">
        ```bash
        npx @better-auth/cli generate
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Add the client plugin
    
    ```ts title="auth-client.ts" 
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

    const client = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            organizationClient() // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
</Step>
</Steps>    


## Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, you can start using the organization plugin to manage your organization's members and teams. The client plugin will provide you methods under the `organization` namespace. And the server `api` will provide you with the necessary endpoints to manage your organization and gives you easier way to call the functions on your own backend.

## Organization

### Create an organization

To create an organization, you need to provide:

- `name`: The name of the organization.
- `slug`: The slug of the organization.
- `logo`: The logo of the organization. (Optional)

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.organization.create({
    name: "My Organization",
    slug: "my-org",
    logo: "https://example.com/logo.png"
})
```


#### Restrict who can create an organization

By default, any user can create an organization. To restrict this, set the `allowUserToCreateOrganization` option to a function that returns a boolean, or directly to `true` or `false`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    //...
    plugins: [
        organization({
            allowUserToCreateOrganization: async (user) => { // [!code highlight]
                const subscription = await getSubscription(user.id) // [!code highlight]
                return subscription.plan === "pro" // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
        })
    ]
})
```


### List User's Organizations

To list the organizations that a user is a member of, you can use `useListOrganizations` hook. It implements a reactive way to get the organizations that the user is a member of.

<Tabs items={["React", "Vue", "Svelte"]} defaultValue="React">
<Tab value="React">
```tsx title="client.tsx"
import { client } from "@/auth/client"

function App(){
    const { data: organizations } = client.useListOrganizations()
    return (
        <div>
            {organizations.map(org => <p>{org.name}</p>)}
        </div>
    )
} 
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Svelte">
```svelte title="page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { client } from "$lib/client";
  const organizations = client.useListOrganizations();
</script>

<h1>Organizations</h1>s

{#if $organizations.isPending}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{:else if $organizations.data === null}
  <p>No organizations found.</p>
{:else}
  <ul>
    {#each $organizations.data as organization}
      <li>{organization.name}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{/if}
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Vue">
```vue title="organization.vue"
<script lang="ts">;
export default {
    setup() {
        const organizations = client.useListOrganizations()
        return { organizations };
    }
};
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <h1>Organizations</h1>
        <div v-if="organizations.isPending">Loading...</div>
        <div v-else-if="organizations.data === null">No organizations found.</div>
        <ul v-else>
            <li v-for="organization in organizations.data" :key="organization.id">
                {{ organization.name }}
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</template>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Active Organization

Active organization is the workspace the user is currently working on. By default when the user is signed in the active organization is set to `null`. You can set the active organization to the user session.

<Callout type="info">
 It's not always you want to persist the active organization in the session. You can manage the active organization in the client side only. For example, multiple tabs can have different active organizations.
</Callout>

#### Set Active Organization

You can set the active organization by calling the `organization.setActive` function. It'll set the active organization for the user session.
<Tabs items={["client", "server"]} defaultValue="client">
  <Tab value="client">
  ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
  import { client } from "@/lib/auth-client";

  await authClient.organization.setActive({
    organizationId: "organization-id"
  })

  // you can also use organizationSlug instead of organizationId
  authClient.organization.setActive({
    organizationSlug: "organization-slug"
  })
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="server">
    ```ts title="api.ts"
    import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

    auth.api.setActiveOrganization({
      headers: // pass the headers,
      body: {
        organizationSlug: "organization-slug"
      }
    })

    // you can also use organizationId instead of organizationSlug
    auth.api.setActiveOrganization({
      headers: // pass the headers,
      body: {
        organizationId: "organization-id"
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To set active organization when a session is created you can use [database hooks](/docs/concepts/database#database-hooks).

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
      session: {
          create: {
              before: async(session)=>{
                  const organization = await getActiveOrganization(session.userId)
                  return {
                    data: {
                      ...session,
                      activeOrganizationId: organization.id
                    }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
})
```

#### Use Active Organization

To retrieve the active organization for the user, you can call the `useActiveOrganization` hook. It returns the active organization for the user. Whenever the active organization changes, the hook will re-evaluate and return the new active organization.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
    <Tab value="React">   
    ```tsx title="client.tsx" 
    import { client } from "@/auth/client"

    function App(){
        const { data: activeOrganization } = client.useActiveOrganization()
        return (
            <div>
                {activeOrganization ? <p>{activeOrganization.name}</p> : null}
            </div>
        )
    } 
    ``` 
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Svelte">   
    ```tsx title="client.tsx" 
    <script lang="ts">
    import { client } from "$lib/client";
    const activeOrganization = client.useActiveOrganization();
    </script>

    <h2>Active Organization</h2>

    {#if $activeOrganization.isPending}
    <p>Loading...</p>
    {:else if $activeOrganization.data === null}
    <p>No active organization found.</p>
    {:else}
    <p>{$activeOrganization.data.name}</p>
    {/if}
    ``` 
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Vue">   
    ```vue title="organization.vue" 
    <script lang="ts">;
    export default {
        setup() {
            const activeOrganization = client.useActiveOrganization();
            return { activeOrganization };
        }
    };
    </script>

    <template>
        <div>
            <h2>Active organization</h2>
            <div v-if="activeOrganization.isPending">Loading...</div>
            <div v-else-if="activeOrganization.data === null">No active organization.</div>
            <div v-else>
                {{ activeOrganization.data.name }}
            </div>
        </div>
    </template>
    ``` 
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Get Full Organization

To get the full details of an organization, you can use the `getFullOrganization` function provided by the client. The function takes an object with the following properties:

- `organizationId`: The id of the organization. (Optional) – By default, it will use the active organization.
- `organizationSlug`: The slug of the organization. (Optional) – To get the organization by slug.

<Tabs items={["client", "server"]}>

  <Tab value="client">
  ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
  const organization = await authClient.organization.getFullOrganization({
      organizationId: "organization-id" // optional, by default it will use the active organization
  })
  //you can also use organizationSlug instead of organizationId
  const organization = await authClient.organization.getFullOrganization({
      organizationSlug: "organization-slug"
  })
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="server">
    ```ts title="api.ts"
    import { auth } from "@/auth";

    auth.api.getFullOrganization({
        headers: // pass the headers
    })

    //  you can also use organizationSlug instead of organizationId
    auth.api.getFullOrganization({
        headers: // pass the headers,
        query: {
            organizationSlug: "organization-slug"
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



## Invitations

To add a member to an organization, we first need to send an invitation to the user. The user will receive an email/sms with the invitation link. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be added to the organization.

### Setup Invitation Email

For member invitation to work we first need to provider `sendInvitationEmail` to the `better-auth` instance. This function is responsible for sending the invitation email to the user.

You'll need to construct and send the invitation link to the user. The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used with the acceptInvitation function when the user clicks on it.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"
import { sendOrganizationInvitation } from "./email"
export const auth = betterAuth({
	plugins: [
		organization({
			async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
                const inviteLink = `https://example.com/accept-invitation/${data.id}`
				sendOrganizationInvitation({
					    email: data.email,
						invitedByUsername: data.inviter.user.name,
						invitedByEmail: data.inviter.user.email,
						teamName: data.organization.name,
						inviteLink
					})
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

### Send Invitation

To invite users to an organization, you can use the `invite` function provided by the client. The `invite` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `role`: The role of the user in the organization. It can be `admin`, `member`, or `guest`.
- `organizationId`: The id of the organization. this is optional by default it will use the active organization. (Optional)

```ts title="invitation.ts"
await authClient.organization.inviteMember({
    email: "test@email.com",
    role: "admin",
})
```


### Accept Invitation

When a user receives an invitation email, they can click on the invitation link to accept the invitation. The invitation link should include the invitation ID, which will be used to accept the invitation.

Make sure to call the `acceptInvitation` function after the user is logged in. 

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.organization.acceptInvitation({
    invitationId: "invitation-id"
})
```

### Update Invitation Status
        
To update the status of invitation you can use the `acceptInvitation`, `cancelInvitation`, `rejectInvitation` functions provided by the client. The functions take the invitation id as an argument.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
//cancel invitation
await authClient.organization.cancelInvitation({
    invitationId: "invitation-id"
})

//reject invitation (needs to be called when the user who received the invitation is logged in)
await authClient.organization.rejectInvitation({
    invitationId: "invitation-id"
})
```


### Get Invitation

To get an invitation you can use the `getInvitation` function provided by the client. You need to provide the invitation id as a query parameter.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
client.organization.getInvitation({
    query: {
        id: params.id
    }
})
```

## Members

### Remove Member 

To remove you can use `organization.removeMember`

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
//remove member
await authClient.organization.removeMember({
    memberId: "member-id"
})
```

### Update Member Role

To update the role of a member in an organization, you can use the `organization.updateMemberRole`. If the user has the permission to update the role of the member, the role will be updated.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.organization.updateMemberRole({
    memberId: "member-id",
    role: "admin"
})
```

### Get Active Member

To get the current member of the organization you can use the `organization.getActiveMember` function. This function will return the current active member.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const member = await authClient.organization.getActiveMember()
```

### Add Member

If you want to add a member directly to an organization without sending an invitation, you can use the `addMember` function which can only be invoked on the server.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

auth.api.addMember({
  body: {
      userId: "user-id",
      organizationId: "organization-id",
      role: "admin"
  }
})
```

## Access Control

The organization plugin providers a very flexible access control system. You can control the access of the user based on the role they have in the organization. You can define your own set of permissions based on the role of the user.

### Roles

By default, there are three roles in the organization:

`owner`: The user who created the organization by default. The owner has full control over the organization and can perform any action.

`admin`: Users with the admin role have full control over the organization except for deleting the organization or changing the owner.

`member`: Users with the member role have limited control over the organization. They can create projects, invite users, and manage projects they have created.


### Permissions

By default, there are three resources, and these have two to three actions.

**organization**: 

    `update` `delete`

**member**: 

    `create` `update` `delete`

**invitation**: 
    
    `create` `cancel`

The owner have full control over all the resources and actions. The admin have full control over all the resources except for deleting the organization or changing the owner. The member have no control over any of those action other than reading the data.

### Custom Permissions

the plugin providers easy way to define your own set of permission for each role.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    #### Create Access Control

    You first need to create access controller by calling `createAccessControl` function and passing the statement object. The statement object should have the resource name as the key and the array of actions as the value.
    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    /**
     * make sure to use `as const` so typescript can infer the type correctly
     */
    const statement = { // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    } as const; // [!code highlight]

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement); // [!code highlight]
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    #### Create Roles

    Once you have created the access controller you can create roles with the permissions you have defined.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    const statement = { 
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const; 

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement); 

    const member = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const admin = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight] 
        project: ["create", "update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const owner = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const myCustomRole = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
        organization: ["update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]
    ```

      When you create custom roles for existing roles, the predefined permissions for those roles will be overridden. To add the existing permissions to the custom role, you need to import `defaultStatement` and merge it with your new statement, plus merge the roles' permissions set with the default roles.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl, defaultStatements, adminAc } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    const statement = { 
        ...defaultStatements, // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;
    
    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const admin = ac.newRole({
        project: ["create", "update"],
        ...adminAc.statements, // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```

    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Pass Roles to the Plugin

        Once you have created the roles you can pass them to the organization plugin both on the client and the server.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { ac, owner, admin, member } from "@/auth/permissions"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                organization({
                    ac: ac,
                    roles: {
                        owner,
                        admin,
                        member,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                }),
            ],
        });
        ```

        You also need to pass the access controller and the roles to the client plugin.

        ```ts title="auth-client"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        import { ac } from "@/auth/permissions"

        export const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                organizationClient({
                    ac: ac,
                    roles: {
                        owner,
                        admin,
                        member,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Access Control Usage

**Has Permission**:

You can use the `hasPermission` action provided by the `api` to check the permission of the user.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";
    auth.api.hasPermission({
        headers: await headers(),
        body: {
            permission: {
                project: ["create"] // This must match the structure in your access control
            }
        }
    });
```

If you want to check the permission of the user on the client from the server you can use the `hasPermission` function provided by the client. 

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    permission: {
        project: ["create"]
    }
})
```

**Check Role Permission**:

Once you have defined the roles and permissions to avoid checking the permission from the server you can use the `checkRolePermission` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = client.organization.checkRolePermission({
	permission: {
		organization: ["delete"],
	},
	role: "admin",
});
```

## Schema

The organization plugin adds the following tables to the database:

### Organization

Table Name: `organization`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    { 
      name: "id", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "Unique identifier for each organization",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },

      name: "organizationId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The id of the organization",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    { 
      name: "role", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The role of the user in the organization" 
    },
    { 
      name: "status", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The status of the invitation" 
    },
    { 
      name: "expiresAt", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "Timestamp of when the invitation expires" 
    },
    { 
      name: "createdAt", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "Timestamp of when the invitation was created" 
    },
  ]}
  />

### Session

Table Name: `session` 

You need to add one more field to the session table to store the active organization id.

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    { 
      name: "activeOrganizationId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The id of the active organization",
      isOptional: true
    },
  ]}
  />

### Customizing the Schema

To change the schema table name or fields, you can pass `schema` option to the organization plugin. 

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [organization({
    schema: {
      organization: {
        modelName: "organizations",  //map the organization table to organizations
        fields: { 
          name: "title" //map the name field to title
        }
      }
    }
  })]
})
```
