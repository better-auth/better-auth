The phone number plugin extends the authentication system by allowing users to sign in and sign up using their phone number. It includes OTP (One-Time Password) functionality to verify phone numbers.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { phoneNumber } from "better-auth/plugins"

        const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ 
                phoneNumber({  // [!code highlight]
                    sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => { // [!code highlight]
                        // Implement sending OTP code via SMS // [!code highlight]
                    } // [!code highlight]
                }) // [!code highlight]
            ] 
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { phoneNumberClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const authClient =  createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                phoneNumberClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Send OTP for Verification

To send an OTP to a user's phone number for verification, you can use the `sendVerificationCode` endpoint.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.phoneNumber.sendOtp({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890"
})
```

### Verify Phone Number

After the OTP is sent, users can verify their phone number by providing the code.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.verify({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    code: "123456"
})
```

When the phone number is verified, the `phoneNumberVerified` field in the user table is set to `true`. If `disableSession` is not set to `true`, a session is created for the user. Additionally, if `callbackOnVerification` is provided, it will be called.

### Allow Sign-Up with Phone Number

to allow users to sign up using their phone number, you can pass `signUpOnVerification` option to your plugin configuration. It requires you to pass `getTempEmail` function to generate a temporary email for the user.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        phoneNumber({
            sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => {
                // Implement sending OTP code via SMS
            },
            signUpOnVerification: {
                getTempEmail: (phoneNumber) => {
                    return `${phoneNumber}@my-site.com`
                },
                //optionally, you can also pass `getTempName` function to generate a temporary name for the user
                getTempName: (phoneNumber) => {
                    return phoneNumber //by default, it will use the phone number as the name
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

### SignIn with Phone number

In addition to signing in a user using send-verify flow, you can also use phone number as an identifier and sign in a user using phone number and password.

```ts
await authClient.signIn.phoneNumber({
    phoneNumber: "+123456789",
    password: "password",
    rememberMe: true //optional defaults to true
})
```

### Update Phone Number

Updating phone number uses the same process as verifying a phone number. The user will receive an OTP code to verify the new phone number.


```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.phoneNumber.sendOtp({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890" // New phone number
})
```

Then verify the new phone number with the OTP code. 

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.verify({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    code: "123456",
    updatePhoneNumber: true // Set to true to update the phone number
})
```

if user session exist the phone number will be updated automatically


### Disable Session Creation

By default, the plugin creates a session for the user after verifying the phone number. You can disable this behavior by passing `disableSession: true` to the `verify` method.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.verify({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    code: "123456",
    disableSession: true
})
```

### Forget Password

To initiate a forget password flow using `phoneNumber`, you can start by calling `forgetPassword` on the client to send an OTP code to the user's phone number.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.phoneNumber.forgetPassword({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890"
})
```

Then, you can reset the password by calling `restPassword` on the client with the OTP code and the new password.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.restPassword({
    otp: "123456", // OTP code sent to the user's phone number
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    newPassword: "newPassword"
})  
```

## Options

- `otpLength`: The length of the OTP code to be generated. Default is `6`.
- `sendOTP`: A function that sends the OTP code to the user's phone number. It takes the phone number and the OTP code as arguments.
- `verifyOTP`: A custom function to verify the OTP code. It takes the phone number and the OTP code as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the code is valid.
- `expiresIn`: The time in seconds after which the OTP code expires. Default is `300` seconds.
- `callbackOnVerification`: A function that is called after the phone number is verified. It takes the phone number and the user object as the first argument and a request object as the second argument.
```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        phoneNumber({
            sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => {
                // Implement sending OTP code via SMS
            },
            callbackOnVerification: async ({ phoneNumber, user }, request) => {
                // Implement callback after phone number verification
            }
        })
    ]
})
```
- `phoneNumberValidator`: A custom function to validate the phone number. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the phone number is valid.
- `signUpOnVerification`: An object with the following properties:
    - `getTempEmail`: A function that generates a temporary email for the user. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns the temporary email.
    - `getTempName`: A function that generates a temporary name for the user. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns the temporary name.
    

## Schema

The plugin requires 2 fields to be added to the user table 

### User Table
<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
            name: "phoneNumber", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "The phone number of the user",
            isUnique: true
        },
        { 
            name: "phoneNumberVerified", 
            type: "boolean", 
            description: "Whether the phone number is verified or not",
            defaultValue: false
        },
    ]}
    />
