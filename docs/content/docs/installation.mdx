<Steps>
    <Step>
         ### Install better-auth
        Start by installing the better-auth package. Youâ€™ll need to install it on both the server and client if youâ€™re using a separate architecture.

        ```package-install
        better-auth
        ``` 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Set Environment Variables

        Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

        **Set Secret**

        Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. **You can generate one using the button below**  or you can use something like openssl.
        ```txt title=".env"
        BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
        ```
        <GenerateSecret/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create A Better Auth Instance
        better auth requries a file called `auth.ts` or `auth.config.ts` to be present in the root directory or one of the following directories:
        - `lib/`
        - `utils/`

        any of these directories can also be nested under `src/` directory.

        <Callout type="warn">
          Make sure to export the auth instance from the file. With the virable name `auth`.
        </Callout>

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            //...
        })
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
                The auth object has 2 properties: 
            - `handler`: This is the handler that will be used to handle requests to the auth server. You'll configure this in the next step.
            - `api`: A collection of methods you can call directly on the server to interact with the auth server, such as **getSession** to retrieve the current session.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Database 
        
        Better Auth requires a database to store user data. It currently only supports `sqlite`, `postgresql` and `mysql`.
        
        ```ts twoslash title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite", // or "mysql", "postgresql"
                url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database
            }
        })
        ```
        <Callout type="info">
            Better auth uses <Link href="https://kysely.dev/">Kysley</Link> under the hood. You can pass a Kysley dialect directly to the auth instance.
        </Callout>

       **Push Schema**
        
       Better Auth includes a CLI tool to migrate the required schema to your database. Run the following command to perform the migration:
        ```bash
        npx better-auth migrate
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Authentication Methods
        Configure the authentication methods you want to use. Better auth comes with built-in support for email/password, and social sign-on providers.

        ```ts
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { github } from "better-auth/social-providers"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite",
                url: "./db.sqlite",
            },
            socialProvider: [ // [!code highlight]
                github({  // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string,  // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }),  // [!code highlight]
            ], // [!code highlight]
            emailAndPassword: {  // [!code highlight]
                enabled: true // [!code highlight]
            }// [!code highlight]
        }); 
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
            You can use even more authentication methods like passkey, username, magic link and more through plugins.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Mount Handler
        To handle api requests, you need to set up a route handler on your server. 
        
        Create a new file or route in your framework's designated catch-all route handler. This route should handle requests for the path `/api/auth/*` (unless you've configured a different base path).

                import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

                export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create Client

        The client side of the library lets you interact with the auth server and includes state management for methods like useSession. Adding plugins may introduce additional methods, like `twoFactor.enable` from the twoFactor plugin.
                
        To get started, just import and call the `createAuthClient` function from the **appropriate package**.

        <Callout type="warn">
         Make sure you import the client from the correct path.
