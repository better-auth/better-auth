description: Better Auth now collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage.

## Why is telemetry collected?

Telemetry data helps us understand how Better Auth is being used across different environments so we can improve performance, prioritize features, and fix issues more effectively. Telemetry data helps us improve Better Auth by giving us insight into how itâ€™s used in real-world environments. It guides our decisions on performance optimizations, feature development, and bug fixes. All data is collected anonymously and with privacy in mind, and users can opt out at any time.

## What is being collected?

The following are all the usage data points that get reported in Better Auth's telemetry event.

<Telemetry />

You can audit telemetry locally by setting the `BETTER_AUTH_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1` environment variable when running your project. In this debug mode, telemetry events are logged only to the console.

## How is my data protected?

All collected data is fully anonymous and only useful in aggregate. It cannot be traced back to any individual source and is accessible only to a small group of core Better Auth maintainers to guide roadmap decisions.

We do not collect, store, or track any personally identifiable information (PII). The telemetry data we collect will never be sold or monetized in any way.

## How can I disable it?

You can disable telemetry collection in your auth config or by setting an environment variable.

- Via your auth config.

  ```ts title="auth.ts"
  export const auth = betterAuth({
    // [!code highlight]
    telemetry: { // [!code highlight]
      enabled: false // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
  });
  ```

- Via an environment variable.

  ```env title=".env"
  # Enable telemetry
  BETTER_AUTH_TELEMETRY=1

  # Disable telemetry
  BETTER_AUTH_TELEMETRY=0
  ```
