        git checkout main

        # Pull latest changes
        git pull upstream main

        # Create and switch to a new branch
        git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 2. Start development server

        Start the development server:

        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```

        To start the docs server:

        ```bash
        pnpm -F docs dev

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 3. Make Your Changes

        * Make your changes to the codebase.

        * Write tests if needed. (Read more about testing <Link href="/docs/contribute/testing">here</Link>)

        * Update documentation.  (Read more about documenting <Link href="/docs/contribute/documenting">here</Link>)

    </Step>

</Steps>


### Issues and Bug Fixes

- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues) for tasks labeled `good first issue`
- When reporting bugs, include steps to reproduce and expected behavior
- Comment on issues you'd like to work on to avoid duplicate efforts

### Framework Integrations

We welcome contributions to support more frameworks:

- Focus on framework-agnostic solutions where possible
- Keep integrations minimal and maintainable
- All integrations currently live in the main package

### Plugin Development

- For core plugins: Open an issue first to discuss your idea
- For community plugins: Feel free to develop independently
- Follow our plugin architecture guidelines

### Documentation

- Fix typos and errors
- Add examples and clarify existing content
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. Place test files next to the source files they test:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { getTestInstance } from "./test-utils/test-instance";

describe("Feature", () => {
    it("should work as expected", async () => {
        const { client } = getTestInstance();
        // Test code here
        expect(result).toBeDefined();
    });
});
```

### Testing Best Practices

- Write clear commit messages
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Add tests for new features
- Follow our coding standards
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change
