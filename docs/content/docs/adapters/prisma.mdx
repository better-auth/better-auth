description: Integrate Better Auth with Prisma.

Prisma ORM is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management in applications by providing a type-safe query builder and an intuitive data modeling interface.
Read more [here](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Prisma installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Prisma adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "sqlite",
  }),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">Prisma Schema Generation</p>
    </th>
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">Prisma Schema Migration</p>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr className="h-10">
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
    <td>❌ Not Supported</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```
