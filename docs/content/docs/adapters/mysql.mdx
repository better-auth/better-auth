description: Integrate Better Auth with MySQL.
---

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for building web applications and other types of software. It provides a flexible and scalable database solution that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Read more here: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have MySQL installed and configured.
Then, you can connect it straight into Better Auth.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { createPool } from "mysql2/promise";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: createPool({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "password",
    database: "database",
  }),
});
```

  [MySQLDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/MysqlDialect.html).

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">MySQL Schema Generation</p>
    </th>
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">MySQL Schema Migration</p>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr className="h-10">
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

## Additional Information

MySQL is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. (<Link href="/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases">Read more here</Link>)
