description: Integrate Better Auth with MongoDB.
---

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for building scalable and flexible applications. It provides a flexible schema that allows for easy data modeling and querying.
Read more here: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and configured.
Then, you can use the mongodb adapter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import { mongodbAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/mongodb";
 
const client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/database");
const db = client.db()
 
export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: mongodbAdapter(db)
})
```

## Schema generaton

âœ… The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) **supports** Drizzle ORM.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

This will generate the right schema for your Drizzle ORM instance.

Once you've ensured that all of your schema's are setup correctly, you can run the push command to apply the schema to your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
drizzle-kit push
```
