description: Integrate Better Auth with Redis.

---

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
In Better Auth, Redis can be used as a session store to manage user sessions and authentication tokens.
Read more [here](https://redis.io/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Redis installed and configured.
Then, use the Redis adapter to connect to your Redis instance.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { redisAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/redis";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    ...,
    secondaryStorage: redisAdapter({
        connectionString: "redis://localhost:6379",
    }),
});
```

## Additional Information

The Redis adapter uses **ioredis** to connect to Redis.
You can also use databases like **Dragonfly**, which follow the same API as Redis.
