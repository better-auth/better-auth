title: Redis Adapter
description: Integrate Better Auth with Redis.
---

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, message broker, and queue, known for its exceptional speed and versatility.

<Callout type="warn">
  Key-Value stores like Redis are well-suited for basic authentication scenarios
  such as email-password authentication. However, when using more complex
  plugins or features that require sophisticated queries, you may experience
  slower performance as KV databases aren't optimized for complex data
  relationships and filtering operations that relational databases excel at.
</Callout>

## Example Usage

Install the `redis` package.

```package-install
npm install redis
```

Then initiate the redis client and pass it to the `redisAdapter` function.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { redisAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/redis";
import { createClient } from "redis";

const client = await createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL }).connect();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: redisAdapter(client),
});
```

## Schema Generation & Migration

Redis doesn't require schema generation or migration.

## Additional Information

Under the hood, the Redis adapter utilizes hashes to store all data. ([Read more here](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/))
