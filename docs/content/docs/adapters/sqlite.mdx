description: Integrate Better Auth with SQLite.
---

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for local data storage in applications.
Read more [here.](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Example Usage

Make sure you have SQLite installed and configured.
Then, you can connect it straight into Better Auth.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Database("database.sqlite"),
});
```

  For more information, read Kysely's documentation to the
  [SqliteDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/SqliteDialect.html).
</Callout>

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">SQLite Schema Generation</p>
    </th>
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">SQLite Schema Migration</p>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr className="h-10">
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

## Additional Information

SQLite is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. (<Link href="/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases">Read more here</Link>)
