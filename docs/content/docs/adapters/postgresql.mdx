description: Integrate Better Auth with PostgreSQL.
---

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system known for its advanced features, extensibility, and support for complex queries and large datasets.
Read more [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured.
Then, you can connect it straight into Better Auth.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database",
  }),
});
```

  [PostgresDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/PostgresDialect.html).

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr className="border-b">
      <th>
        <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">PostgreSQL Schema Generation</p>
      </th>
      <th>
        <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">PostgreSQL Schema Migration</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr className="h-10">
      <td>✅ Supported</td>
      <td>✅ Supported</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

## Use a non-default schema

In most cases, the default schema is `public`. To have Better Auth use a
non-default schema (e.g., `auth`) for its tables,
set the PostgreSQL user's default schema before generating or migrating:

```sql
ALTER USER authuser SET SEARCH_PATH TO auth;
```

alternatively, append the option to your connection URI, for example:

```
postgres://<DATABASE_URL>?option=-c search_path=auth
```
URL-encode if needed: `?option=-c%20search_path%3Dauth`.

Ensure the target schema exists and the database user has the required permissions.

## Additional Information

PostgreSQL is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. (<Link href="/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases">Read more here</Link>)
