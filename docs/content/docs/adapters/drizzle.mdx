description: Integrate Better Auth with Drizzle ORM.
---

Drizzle ORM is a powerful and flexible ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, and supports a wide range of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Drizzle installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Drizzle adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { DrizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { db } from "./database.ts";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new DrizzleAdapter(db, {// [!code highlight]
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql" // [!code highlight]
  }), // [!code highlight]
  //... the rest of your config
});
```

## Schema generaton

âœ… The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) **supports** Drizzle ORM.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

This will generate the right schema for your Drizzle ORM instance.

Once you've ensured that all of your schema's are setup correctly, you can run the push command to apply the schema to your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
drizzle-kit push
```
