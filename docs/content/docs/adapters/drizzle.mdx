title: Drizzle ORM Adapter
description: Integrate Better Auth with Drizzle ORM.
---

Drizzle ORM is a powerful and flexible ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, and supports a wide range of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Read more here: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Drizzle installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Drizzle adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { DrizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { db } from "./database.ts";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new DrizzleAdapter(db, {
    // [!code highlight]
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql" // [!code highlight]
  }), // [!code highlight]
  //... the rest of your config
});
```

## Schema generaton & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">Drizzle Schema Generation</p>
    </th>
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">Drizzle Schema Migration</p>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr className="h-10">
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
    <td>
      ❌ Not Supported - Use Drizzle [migration
      command](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/migrations)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
drizzle-kit migrate
```

## Additional Information

The Drizzle adapter expects the schema you define to match the table names. For example, if your Drizzle schema maps the `user` table to `users`, you need to manually pass the schema and map it to the user table.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql"
    schema: {
      ...schema,
      user: schema.users,
    },
    //if all of them are just using plural form, you can just pass the option below
    usePlural: true,
  }),
});
```
