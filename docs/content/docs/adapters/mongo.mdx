description: Integrate Better Auth with MongoDB.
---

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for building scalable and flexible applications. It provides a flexible schema that allows for easy data modeling and querying.
Read more here: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and configured.
Then, you can use the mongodb adapter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import { mongodbAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/database");
const db = client.db();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: mongodbAdapter(db),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

For MongoDB, we don't need to generate or migrate the schema.
