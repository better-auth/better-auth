PouchDB is a JavaScript database that can run in the browser or in Node.js, making it perfect for offline-first applications.
It's designed to sync with CouchDB and compatible servers, enabling you to build applications that work offline and sync when online.

<Callout type="warn">
This adapter is currently in beta. While it's functional and passes all tests, the API and implementation details might change in future releases.

## Example Usage

Make sure you have PouchDB installed and configured.

```bash
// install pouchdb and its plugins, note use appropriate adapter for your use case
npm install pouchdb pouchdb-find pouchdb-adapter-memory
```

Then, you can use the PouchDB adapter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import PouchDB from "pouchdb";
import PouchDBFind from "pouchdb-find";
import PouchDBMemory from "pouchdb-adapter-memory";

import { pouchdbAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/pouchdb";

PouchDB.plugin(PouchDBMemory); // change pouchdb to an appropriate adapter or use a remote instance
PouchDB.plugin(PouchDBFind);

const db = new PouchDB("better-auth");
// remote instance
// const db = new PouchDB("http://localhost:5984/better-auth", { skip_setup: true, auth: { username: "username", password: "password" } });

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: pouchdbAdapter(db),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

For PouchDB, we don't need to generate or migrate the schema.
