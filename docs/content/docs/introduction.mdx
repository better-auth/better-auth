Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code and very short amount time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

## Why Better Auth?

## Features

Better auth is aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:
