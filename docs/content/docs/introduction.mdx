## AI tooling

### LLMs.txt

Better Auth exposes an `LLMs.txt` that helps AI models understand how to integrate and interact with your authentication system. See it at [https://better-auth.com/llms.txt](https://better-auth.com/llms.txt).

### MCP

Better Auth provides an MCP server so you can use it with any AI model that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
