description: Introduction to Better Auth.

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Better Auth?

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a communityâ€”hence, Better Auth.

## Features

Better Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:
