Better Auth is a type-safe, framework-agnostic authentication library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your app instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Better Auth?

*Authentication feels like a partially solved problem, existing open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond a simple login. Third-party services, while convenient, force you to store user data on their servers, which in some ways strips you of ownership and it also comes with its own set of problems. And obviously, these services aren't free and can get really expensive.* 

*Better Auth offers a different approach. It provides a comprehensive authentication library from the core accompanied by a growings plugin ecosystem, that allows you to add many authentication related features in just minutes. Need multi-factor authentication? Simply install our 2FA plugin. Looking to support workspaces, organizations, member roles, or access control for you multi tenant apps? You're a plugin away from having a fully featured auth system.*
