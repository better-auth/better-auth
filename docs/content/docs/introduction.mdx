Better Auth is a framework-agnostic, universal authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, passkey, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO, creating your own IDP, it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Features

Better Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:

## AI tooling

### LLMs.txt

Better Auth exposes an `LLMs.txt` that helps AI models understand how to integrate and interact with your authentication system. See it at [https://better-auth.com/llms.txt](https://better-auth.com/llms.txt).

### MCP

Better Auth provides an MCP server so you can use it with any AI model that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

#### CLI Options

Use the Better Auth CLI to easily add the MCP server to your preferred client:

    <Tab value="Cursor">
      ```bash title="terminal"
      npx @better-auth/cli mcp --cursor
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Claude Code">
      ```bash title="terminal"
      npx @better-auth/cli mcp --claude-code
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Open Code">
      ```bash title="terminal"
      npx @better-auth/cli mcp --open-code
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Manual">
      ```bash title="terminal"
      npx @better-auth/cli mcp --manual
      ```
    </Tab>

#### Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually configure the MCP server for each client:

<Tabs items={["Claude Code", "Open Code", "Manual"]}>
    <Tab value="Claude Code">
      ```bash title="terminal"
      claude mcp add --transport http better-auth https://mcp.chonkie.ai/better-auth/better-auth-builder/mcp
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Open Code">
      ```json title="opencode.json"
        {
            "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
            "mcp": {
                "Better Auth": {
                    "type": "remote",
                    "url": "https://mcp.chonkie.ai/better-auth/better-auth-builder/mcp",
                    "enabled": true,
                }
            }
        }
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Manual">

    {
        "Better Auth": {
            "url": "https://mcp.chonkie.ai/better-auth/better-auth-builder/mcp"
