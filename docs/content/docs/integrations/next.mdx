Better Auth can be easily integrated with Next.js. It'll also comes with utilities to make it easier to use Better Auth with Next.js.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a route file inside `/api/auth/[...all]` directory. And add the following code:

```ts title="api/auth/[...all]/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { GET, POST } = toNextJsHandler(auth.handler);
```

<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react" // make sure to import from better-auth/react

export const client = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and re-render the components when the state changes.

The client also uses [better-fetch](https://github.com/bekacru/better-fetch) to make the requests. You can pass the fetch configuration to the client.

## RSC and Server actions

The `api` object exported from the auth instance contains all the actions that you can perform on the server. Every endpoint made inside Better Auth is a invokable as a function. Including plugins endpoints.

**Example: Getting Session on a server action**

```tsx title="server.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

const someAuthenticatedAction = async () => {
    "use server";
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: headers()
    })
};
```

**Example: Getting Session on a RSC**

```tsx
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

export async function ServerComponent() {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: headers()
    })
    if(!session) {
        return <div>Not authenticated</div>
    }
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome {session.user.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Middleware

In Next.js, middleware doesn’t have access to many Node APIs, so you can’t use the usual `auth` instance to validate sessions directly. Instead, you can make a request to the API route to get the session using the request headers.

Here’s how it looks:

<Callout>
We're using `better-fetch` to make the request to the API route. You can use any fetch library you want.
</Callout>

```ts
import { betterFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";
import type { Session } from "better-auth/types";
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from "next/server";
 
export default async function authMiddleware(request: NextRequest) {
	const { data: session } = await betterFetch<Session>(
		"/api/auth/get-session",
		{
			baseURL: request.nextUrl.origin,
			headers: {
				//get the cookie from the request
				cookie: request.headers.get("cookie") || "",
			},
		},
	);
 
	if (!session) {
		return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", request.url));
	}
	return NextResponse.next();
}
 
export const config = {
	matcher: ["/dashboard"],
};
```
