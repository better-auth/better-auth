Better Auth can be easily integrated with Next.js. It'll also comes with utilities to make it easier to use Better Auth with Next.js.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a route file inside `/api/[...auth]` directory. And add the following code:

```ts title="api/[...auth]/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { GET, POST } = toNextJsHandler(auth.handler);
```

<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/[...auth]`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react" // make sure to import from better-auth/react

export const client = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actinos are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and re-render the components when the state changes.

The client also uses [better-fetch](https://github.com/bekacru/better-fetch) to make the requests. You can pass the fetch configuration to the client.

## RSC and Server actions

The `api` object exported from the auth instance contains all the actions that you can perform on the server. Every endpoint made inside Better Auth is a invokable as a function. Including plugins endpoints.

**Example: Getting Session on a server action**

```tsx title="server.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

const someAuthenticatedAction = async () => {
    "use server";
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: headers()
    })
};
```

**Example: Getting Session on a RSC**

```tsx
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

export async function ServerComponent() {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: headers()
    })
    if(!session) {
        return <div>Not authenticated</div>
    }
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome {session.user.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```


## Middleware

You can use the `authMiddleware` to protect your routes. It's a wrapper around the Next.js middleware.

```ts  title="middleware.ts"s
import { authMiddleware } from "better-auth/next-js"

export default authMiddleware({
    redirectTo: "/sign-in" // redirect to this path if the user is not authenticated
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*'],
}
```

you can also pass custom redirect function

```ts
import { authMiddleware } from "better-auth/next-js";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export default authMiddleware({
	customRedirect: async (session, request) => {
		const baseURL = request.nextUrl.origin;
		if (request.nextUrl.pathname === "/sign-in" && session) {
			return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/dashboard", baseURL));
		}
		if (request.nextUrl.pathname === "/dashboard" && !session) {
			return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", baseURL));
		}
		return NextResponse.next();
	},
});

export const config = {
	matcher: ["/dashboard", "/sign-in"],
};
```
