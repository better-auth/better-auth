title: Hono Integration
description: Hono Integration Guide

This integration guide is assuming you are using Hono with node server.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to hono endpoint.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";

const app = new Hono();

app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/**", (c) => {
	return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});

serve(app);
```
