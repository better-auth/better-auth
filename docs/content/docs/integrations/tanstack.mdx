This integration guide is assuming you are using TanStack Start.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to a TanStack API endpoint.
Create a new file: `/app/routes/api/auth/$.ts`

```ts
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth'
import { createAPIFileRoute } from '@tanstack/start/api'

export const Route = createAPIFileRoute('/api/auth/$')({
  GET: ({ request }) => {
    return auth.handler(request)
  },
  POST: ({ request }) => {
    return auth.handler(request)
  },
})
```

This will allow you to access use the `getSession` method in all of your routes.
