description: Integrate Better Auth with Astro
---

Better Auth comes with first class support for Astro. This guide will show you how to integrate Better Auth with Astro.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to a catch all API route. Create a file inside `/page/api/auth` called `[...all].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="page/api/auth/[...all].ts"
import { auth } from "~/auth";
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";

export const ALL: APIRoute = async (ctx) => {
	return auth.handler(ctx.request);
};
```

<Callout>
    You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Astro supports multiple frontend frameworks, so you can easily import your client based on the framework you're using.

If you're not using a frontend framework, you can still import the vanilla client.

            export const client = createAuthClient()
            ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auth Middleware

To protect your routes, you can check if the user is authenticated using the `getSession` method in middleware. Start by creating a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your project and follow the example below:

```ts title="middleware.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
	const isAuthed = await auth.api
		.getSession({
			headers: context.request.headers,
		})
	if (context.url.pathname === "/dashboard" && !isAuthed) {
		return context.redirect("/");
	}
	return next();
});
```

## Getting session on the server inside `.astro` file

You can use `auth.api` to call the API from the server side. Here is an example of how you can get the session inside an `.astro` file:

```astro
---
import { UserCard } from "@/components/user-card";
import { auth } from "@/auth";

const session = await auth.api.getSession({
	headers: Astro.request.headers,
});
---

<UserCard initalSession={session} />
```
