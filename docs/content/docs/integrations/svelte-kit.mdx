Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SvelteKit server hook.

```ts title="hooks.server.ts"
import { auth } from "$lib/auth";
import { svelteKitHandler } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";

export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
	return svelteKitHandler({ event, resolve, auth });
}
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/svelte" // make sure to import from better-auth/svelte

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    // you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and reflect changes when there is a change like a user signing in or out affecting the session state.

### Example usage
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { authClient } from "$lib/client";
  const session = authClient.useSession();
</script>
    <div>
      {#if $session.data}
        <div>
          <p>
            {$session?.data?.user.name}
          </p>
          <button
            on:click={async () => {
              await authClient.signOut();
            }}
          >
            Sign Out
          </button>
        </div>
      {:else}
        <button
          on:click={async () => {
            await authClient.signIn.social({
              provider: "github",
            });
          }}
        >
          Continue with GitHub
        </button>
      {/if}
    </div>
```
