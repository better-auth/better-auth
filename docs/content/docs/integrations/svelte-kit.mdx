Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SvelteKit server hook.

```ts title="hooks.server.ts"
import { auth } from "$lib/auth";
import { svelteKitHandler } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";
import { building } from "$app/environment";

export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
  return svelteKitHandler({ event, resolve, auth, building });
}
```

### Server Action Cookies

To ensure cookies are properly set when you call functions like `signInEmail` or `signUpEmail` in a server action, you should use the `sveltekitCookies` plugin. This plugin will automatically handle setting cookies for you in SvelteKit.

You need to add it as a plugin to your Better Auth instance.

<Callout>
  The `getRequestEvent` function is available in SvelteKit `2.2.0` and later.
  Make sure you are using a compatible version.
</Callout>

```ts title="lib/auth.ts"
import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sveltekitCookies } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";
import { getRequestEvent } from "$app/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // ... your config
  plugins: [sveltekitCookies(getRequestEvent)],
});
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/svelte"; // make sure to import from better-auth/svelte

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  // you can pass client configuration here
});
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and reflect changes when there is a change like a user signing in or out affecting the session state.

### Example usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { authClient } from "$lib/client";
  const session = authClient.useSession();
</script>
    <div>
      {#if $session.data}
        <div>
          <p>
            {$session?.data?.user.name}
          </p>
          <button
            on:click={async () => {
              await authClient.signOut();
            }}
          >
            Sign Out
          </button>
        </div>
      {:else}
        <button
          on:click={async () => {
            await authClient.signIn.social({
              provider: "github",
            });
          }}
        >
          Continue with GitHub
        </button>
      {/if}
    </div>
```
