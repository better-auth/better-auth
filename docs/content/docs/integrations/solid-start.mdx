description: Integrate Better Auth with SolidStart.
---

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SolidStart server. Put the following code in your `*auth.ts` file inside `/routes/api/auth` folder.

```ts title="*auth.ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";
import { toSolidStartHandler } from "better-auth/solid-start";

export const { GET, POST } = toSolidStartHandler(auth);
```

### Server Function Cookies

To ensure cookies are correctly set when calling functions like `signInEmail` or `signUpEmail` from a server function, use the `solidStartCookies` plugin. This plugin automatically manages cookie handling in SolidStart.

Add it as a plugin to your Better Auth instance:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { solidStartCookies } from "better-auth/solid-start";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // ... your config
  plugins: [solidStartCookies()], // make sure this is the last plugin in the array
});
```
