description: Integrate Better Auth with Expo.
---

Expo is a popular framework for building cross-platform apps with React Native. Better Auth supports both Expo native and web apps.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Configure A Better Auth Backend
        Before using Better Auth with Expo, make sure you have a Better Auth backend set up. You can either use a separate server or leverage Expo's new [API Routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes) feature to host your Better Auth instance.

        To get started, check out our [installation](/docs/installation) guide for setting up Better Auth on your server. If you prefer to check out the full example, you can find it [here](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/tree/main/examples/expo-example).

        To use the new API routes feature in Expo to host your Better Auth instance you can create a new API route in your Expo app and mount the Better Auth handler.

        ```ts title="app/api/auth/[...auth]+api.ts"
        import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"; // import Better Auth handler
        
        const handler = auth.handler;
        export { handler as GET, handler as POST }; // export handler for both GET and POST requests
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Install Better Auth and Expo Plugin

        Install both the expo plugin in your server and both the Better Auth package and the Expo plugin in your Expo app.

        ```package-install
        @better-auth/expo
        ```

        ```package-install
        better-auth
        ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
        ## Add the Expo Plugin on Your Server

        Add the Expo plugin to your Better Auth server.

        ```ts title="server.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { expo } from "@better-auth/expo";

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                expo
            ]
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Initialize Better Auth Client
        
        To initialize Better Auth in your Expo app, you need to call `createAuthClient` with the base url of your Better Auth backend. Make sure to import the client from `/react`.

        You need to also import client plugin from `@better-auth/expo/client` and pass it to the `plugins` array when initializing the auth client.

        This is important because:

        - **Social Authentication Support:** enables social auth flows by handling authorization URLs and callbacks within the Expo web browser.
        - **Secure Cookie Management:** stores cookies securely and automatically adds them to the headers of your auth requests.

        ```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
        import { expoClient } from "@better-auth/expo/client";

        const authClient = createAuthClient({
            baseURL: "http://localhost:8081", /* base url of your Better Auth backend. */
            plugins: [
                expoClient({
                    scheme: "myapp",
                    storagePrefix: "myapp"
                })
            ]
        });
        ```
        <Callout>
         Be sure to include the full URL, including the path, if you've changed the default path from `/api/auth`.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

     <Step>
        ## Scheme and Trusted Origins

        Better Auth uses deep links to redirect users back to your app after authentication. To enable this, you need to add your app's scheme to the `trustedOrigins` list in your Better Auth config. 

        First, make sure you have a scheme defined in your `app.json` file.

        ```json title="app.json"
        {
            "expo": {
                "scheme": "myapp"
            }
        }
        ```

        Then, update your Better Auth config to include the scheme in the `trustedOrigins` list.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            trustedOrigins: ["myapp://"]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
 
    <Step>
        ## Initialize Better Auth Client
        
        To initialize Better Auth in your Expo app, you need to call `createAuthClient` with the base url of your Better Auth backend. Make sure to import the client from `/react`.

        ```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

        const authClient = createAuthClient({
            baseURL: "http://localhost:8081", /* base url of your Better Auth backend. */
        });
        ```
        <Callout>
         Be sure to include the full URL, including the path, if you've changed the default path from `/api/auth`.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Configure Metro Bundler

        To resolve better auth exports you'll need to enable `unstable_enablePackageExports` in your metro config. 

        ```js title="metro.config.js"
        const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

        const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)

        config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true; // [!code highlight]

        module.exports = config;
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Usage

### Authenticating Users

With Better Auth initialized, you can now use the `authClient` to authenticate users in your Expo app.

<Tabs items={["sign-in", "sign-up"]}>
    <Tab value="sign-in">
        ```tsx title="app/sign-in.tsx"
        import { useState } from "react"; 
        import { View, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
        import { authClient } from "./auth-client";

        export default function App() {
            const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
            const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

            const handleLogin = async () => {
            await authClient.signIn.email({
                    email,
                    password,
            })
            };

            return (
                <View>
                    <TextInput
                        placeholder="Email"
                        value={email}
                        onChangeText={setEmail}
                    />
                    <TextInput
                        placeholder="Password"
                        value={password}
                        onChangeText={setPassword}
                    />
                    <Button title="Login" onPress={handleLogin} />
                </View>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="sign-up">
        ```tsx title="app/sign-up.tsx"
        import { useState } from "react";
        import { View, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
        import { authClient } from "./auth-client";

        export default function App() {
            const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
            const [name, setName] = useState("");
            const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

            const handleLogin = async () => {
                await authClient.signUp.email({
                        email,
                        password,
                        name
                })
            };

            return (
                <View>
                    <TextInput
                        placeholder="Name"
                        value={name}
                        onChangeText={setName}
                    />
                    <TextInput
                        placeholder="Email"
                        value={email}
                        onChangeText={setEmail}
                    />
                    <TextInput
                        placeholder="Password"
                        value={password}
                        onChangeText={setPassword}
                    />
                    <Button title="Login" onPress={handleLogin} />
                </View>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

For social sign-in, you can use the `authClient.signIn.social` method with the provider name and a callback URL.

```tsx title="app/social-sign-in.tsx"

import { Button } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
    const handleLogin = async () => {
        await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "google",
            callbackURL: "/dashboard" // this will be converted to a deep link (eg. `myapp://dashboard`) on native
        })
    };
    return <Button title="Login with Google" onPress={handleLogin} />;
}
```

### Session

Better Auth provides a `useSession` hook to access the current user's session in your app.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"

import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

export default function App() {
    const { data: session } = authClient.useSession();

    return <Text>Welcome, {data.user.name}</Text>;
}
```

On native, the session data will be cached in SecureStore. This will allow you to remove the need for a loading spinner when the app is reloaded. You can disable this behavior by passing the `disableCache` option to the client.


### Making Authenticated Requests to Your Server

To make authenticated requests to your server that require the user's session, you have two options:

1. Use the fetch client provided by Better Auth.
2. Retrieve the session cookie from `SecureStore` and manually add it to your request headers.

---

#### Option 1: Using the Fetch Client

Better Auth provides a built-in fetch client powered by [Better Fetch](http://better-fetch.vercel.app). This client automatically includes the session cookie in the headers of your requests.

```tsx
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const $fetch = authClient.$fetch;

// Example usage
$fetch("/api/secure-endpoint", {
  method: "GET",
});
```

For more details, see the [Better Fetch documentation](http://better-fetch.vercel.app/docs).

#### Option 2: Adding the Cookie to Request Headers

If you prefer using your own fetch client, you can retrieve the session cookie stored in the device using `authClient.getCookie` and manually add it to your request headers.

```tsx
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const makeAuthenticatedRequest = async () => {
  const cookies = authClient.getCookie(); // [!code highlight]
  const headers = {
    "Cookie": cookies, // [!code highlight]
  };
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8081/api/secure-endpoint", { headers });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

**Example: Usage With TRPC**
    
```tsx title="lib/trpc-provider.tsx"
//...other imports
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"; // [!code highlight]

export const api = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();

export function TRPCProvider(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());
  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>
    api.createClient({
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({
          //...your other options
          headers() {
            const headers = new Map<string, string>(); // [!code highlight]
            const cookies = authClient.getCookie(); // [!code highlight]
            if (cookies) { // [!code highlight]
              headers.set("Cookie", cookies); // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
            return Object.fromEntries(headers); // [!code highlight]
          },
        }),
      ],
    }),
  );

  return (
    <api.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {props.children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </api.Provider>
  );
}
```


## Options

**storage**: on native you can pass a storage option to the client to change the storage mechanism. By default, the client will use SecureStore.

```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    storage: AsyncStorage
});
```

**scheme**: scheme is used to deep link back to your app after a user has authenticated using oAuth providers. By default, Better Auth tries to read the scheme from the `app.json` file. If you need to override this, you can pass the scheme option to the client.

```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    scheme: "myapp"
});
```

**disableCache**: By default, the client will cache the session data in SecureStore. You can disable this behavior by passing the `disableCache` option to the client.

```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    disableCache: true
});
```
