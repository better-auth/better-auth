Better Auth can be integrated with node based backed frameworks. The guide below will show you how to integrate Better Auth with express.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a catch-all route to manage all requests to `/api/auth/*` (or any other path specified in your Better Auth options).

```ts title="server.ts"
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After completing the setup, start your server. Better Auth will be ready to use. You can send a `GET` request to the `/ok` endpoint (`/api/auth/ok`) to verify that the server is running.
