description: Integrate Better Auth with Node.

Better Auth can be integrated with node based backed frameworks. The guide below will show you how to integrate Better Auth with express.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

<Callout>
Note that CommonJS (cjs) isn't supported. Use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` or configuring your `tsconfig.json` to use ES modules.
</Callout>

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a catch-all route to manage all requests to `/api/auth/*` (or any other path specified in your Better Auth options).

<Callout type="warn">
Donâ€™t use `express.json()` before the Better Auth handler. Use it only for other routes, or the client API will get stuck on "pending".
</Callout>

```ts title="server.ts"
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

// Mount express json middleware after Better Auth handler
// or only apply it to routes that don't interact with Better Auth
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After completing the setup, start your server. Better Auth will be ready to use. You can send a `GET` request to the `/ok` endpoint (`/api/auth/ok`) to verify that the server is running.

### Getting the User Session

To retrieve the user's session, you can use the `getSession` method provided by the `auth` object. This method requires the request headers to be passed in a specific format. To simplify this process, Better Auth provides a `fromNodeHeaders` helper function that converts Node.js request headers to the format expected by Better Auth (a `Headers` object).

Here's an example of how to use `getSession` in an Express route:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { fromNodeHeaders } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth"; //your better auth instance

app.get("/api/me", async (req, res) => {
 	const session = await auth.api.getSession({
      headers: fromNodeHeaders(req.headers),
    });
	return res.json(session);
});
```
