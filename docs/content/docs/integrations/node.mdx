Better Auth can be integrated with node based backed frameworks. The guide below will show you how to integrate Better Auth with express.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a catch-all route to manage all requests to `/api/auth/*` (or any other path specified in your Better Auth options).

```ts title="server.ts"
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After completing the setup, start your server. Better Auth will be ready to use. You can send a `GET` request to the `/ok` endpoint (`/api/auth/ok`) to verify that the server is running.

### Getting the User Session

To retrieve the user's session, you can use the `getSession` method provided by the `auth` object. This method requires the request headers to be passed in a specific format. To simplify this process, Better Auth provides a `fromNodeHeaders` helper function that converts Node.js request headers to the format expected by Better Auth (a `Headers` object).

Here's an example of how to use `getSession` in an Express route:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { fromNodeHeaders } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth"; //your better auth instance

app.get("/api/me", async (req, res) => {
 	const session = await auth.getSession({
      headers: fromNodeHeaders(req.headers),
    });
	return res.json(session);
});
```
