Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a file inside `/server/api` called `[...auth].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server/api/[...auth].ts"
import { auth } from "~/utils/auth.config";

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
	return auth.handler(toWebRequest(event));
});
```
<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/[...auth]`
</Callout>

### Migrate the database
Run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
npx better-auth migrate
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/vue" // make sure to import from better-auth/vue

export const client = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actinos are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and re-render the components when the state changes.

### Example usage

```vue title="index.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { client } from "~/lib/client"
const session = client.useSession()
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <button v-if="!session?.data" @click="() => client.signIn.social({
            provider: 'github'
        })">
            Continue with github
        </button>
        <div>
            <pre>{{ session.data }}</pre>
            <button v-if="session.data" @click="client.signOut()">
                Sign out
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```
