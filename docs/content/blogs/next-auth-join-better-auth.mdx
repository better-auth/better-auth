# The Auth.js project is joining Better Auth

We’re excited to announce that [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev), formerly known as NextAuth.js, is now being maintained and overseen by Better Auth. For anyone who hasn’t crossed paths with the project, Auth.js has long been one of the most widely used open source authentication libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Chances are, if you’ve used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Google Labs](https://labs.google), [Cal.com](https://cal.com) or a million other websites, you’ve already interacted with Auth.js.  

For me personally, Auth.js was the initial spark that pushed me toward building Better Auth. I’ve not been a fan of the idea of outsourcing authentication and user data management fundamentally critical infrastructure to a service you don’t control. Auth.js was that solution that helped me and many other developers to own their auth.

But when you build a lot of apps the scope of NextAuth often left you building the same higher-level primitives over and over again. I remember one of the recurring example was an organization system I needed across multiple applications. I even tried to formalize this as a separate project called [NextOrg](https://github.com/bekacru/next-org), which was designed to layer organizational support on top of NextAuth. I never got to finish it because NextAuth was not designed to be broadly extensible and I kept hitting walls.

That frustration eventually crystallized into the idea for Better Auth: an authentication framework that takes a minimal but deliberate core, provides a sensible baseline of features out of the box, and then enables anything beyond that through a structured plugin system. The vision was that, instead of endlessly hacking on top of the library, you could pull in a plugin for organizations, or two-factor, or billing integrations, and it would slot into place as a first-class extension. A framework that starts simple but scales in capability without forcing the user to abandon ownership of their data or their stack.

After six months of iteration, refining the core abstractions, testing the plugin API, ensuring the adapter primitives could scale across databases, and obsessing over the documentation, we shipped the first beta at the end of September. The reaction from the community was immediate. People understood the direction, began experimenting, contributed plugins, and pushed the system forward. That momentum carried us into the first stable release and to where we are now. We now have more than 27 1st party plugins and a lot more plugins maintained by a community and even other companies like Polar, Autumn, Dub and so on. The ecosystem began to compound much faster than I have ever imagined.

Which brings us full circle. The project that originally inspired Better Auth is now part of Better Auth itself. We want to continue addressing security patches and urgent issues as they arise. However, we do not plan to maintain two fully independent projects indefinitely. Our team is small and already stretched maintaining Better Auth itself, so while Auth.js will not be abandoned, we strongly encourage new projects to start directly on Better Auth unless there is a very specific feature gap (notably stateless session management). Our roadmap is to bring those capabilities into Better Auth, so the ecosystem can converge rather than fragment.

We are deeply grateful to the Auth.js community and core maintainers who have carried the project to this point. In particular, Balázs, who served as lead maintainer, pushed through difficult phases, brought in new primitives, and kept the project alive long enough for this transition to even be possible. What we see here is not an ending but a consolidation - a way of ensuring continuity while also accelerating the direction forward.

For teams considering migration, we have prepared a guide, though there is no urgency. The entire purpose of bringing Auth.js under Better Auth’s stewardship is to avoid disruption to developers who depend on it and to provide a stable path forward. NextAuth/Auth.js has been one of the most impactful open source projects in the JavaScript authentication space, and it feels fitting that its influence continues, not as a legacy artifact, but as part of a broader evolution in how authentication is built in TypeScript ecosystems.

Better Auth was born out of the limitations of Auth.js, and now, together, the two projects can carry the ecosystem further. The end goal remains unchanged: you should own your auth!
