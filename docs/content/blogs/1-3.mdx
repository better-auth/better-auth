        clientSecret: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      },

        issuer: "better-auth-example",
        certificate: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
      },
      // provider limit
      providersLimit: async (user) => {

      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Sveltekit Cookie Helper Plugin 

Helper utilities for working with cookies in SvelteKit Server actions.

<Callout type="warn">
  Breaking: building and getRequestEvent() now need to be passed in as props.
</Callout>

import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sveltekitCookies } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";

});

    }),
  ],
});
```

        organization: {
          additionalFields: {
            // ...
          }
        },
        member: {
          additionalFields: {
            // ...
          }
        },
        invitation: {
          additionalFields: {
            // ...
          }
        },
      }
