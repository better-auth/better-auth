## üöÄ Highlights

### **SSO Plugin**

The SSO plugin has been moved to its own package and now supports both **OIDC** and **SAML 2.0**.

üëâ [Read the SSO docs](/docs/plugins/sso)

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sso } from "@better-auth/sso";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    sso({
      oidc: {
        clientId: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_ID!,
        clientSecret: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      },
      saml: {
        entryPoint: "https://example.com/saml",
        issuer: "better-auth-example",
        certificate: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
      },
      providersLimit: async (user) => {
        const plan = await getUserPlan(user);
        return plan.name === "pro" ? 10 : 1;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

üëâ [Read MCP docs](/docs/plugins/mcp)

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { mcp } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    mcp({
      loginPage: "/login",
    }),
  ],
});
```

---

### **Stripe Plugin is now production ready**

The Stripe plugin is now stable and usage based pricing is coming very soon.

üëâ [Read Stripe docs](/docs/plugins/stripe)


```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { stripe } from "@better-auth/stripe";

  plugins: [
    stripe({
      // ...
    }),
  ],

  plugins: [
    siwe(),
  ],
});
```

---

### **New Social Providers**

We‚Äôve added providers for **Notion, Slack, Linear, and Faceit**.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    notion: { /* ... */ },
    slack: { /* ... */ },
    linear: { /* ... */ },
    faceit: { /* ... */ },
  },
});
```

---

### **SvelteKit Cookie Helper Plugin**

Utilities for handling cookies in SvelteKit server actions.

<Callout type="warn">
  Breaking change: `building` and `getRequestEvent()` must now be passed in as props.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sveltekitCookies } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";
import { getRequestEvent } from "$app/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [sveltekitCookies(getRequestEvent)],
});
```

---

### **Email Verification on Sign‚ÄëIn**

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  emailVerification: {
    sendOnSignIn: true, // sends a verification email on sign‚Äëin if the user isn‚Äôt verified
  },
});
```

---

### **Multi‚ÄëTeam Support**

The organization plugin now supports members belonging to multiple teams.

**Breaking change:**
`teamId` has been removed from the `member` table. A new `teamMembers` table is required.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      // ...
    }),
  ],
});
```

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import { auth } from "./auth";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  // pass your auth instance to infer additional fields
  plugins: [organizationClient({ $inferAuth: {} as typeof auth })], // [!code highlight]
});
```

---

### **Additional Organization Fields**

Add custom fields to `organization`, `member`, and `invitation` models.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      schema: {
        organization: { additionalFields: { /* ... */ } },
        member: { additionalFields: { /* ... */ } },
        invitation: { additionalFields: { /* ... */ } },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Other new options:

* `maximumMembersPerTeam` ‚Äì set team member limits
* `listUserInvitations` ‚Äì list all invitations for a user

---

### **Generic OAuth Improvements**

* Added support for extra token URL params
* OAuth token encryption options

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    genericOAuth({
      // ...
    }),
  ],
});
```
