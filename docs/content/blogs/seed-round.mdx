## Announcing our $5M seed round

We’re excited to share that Better Auth has raised a $5 million seed round led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), with participation from Y Combinator, Chapter One, P1 Ventures, and a group of incredible investors and angels.

This funding fuels the next phase of **Better Auth**.

From the start we are obsessed with making it possible for developers to **own their auth**. To **democratize high quality authentication** and make rolling your own auth not just doable, but the obvious choice.

It started with building the framework. Since then, we’ve seen incredible growth and support from the community. Thank you everyone for being part of this journey. It’s still early days, and there’s so much more to build. This funding will allow us to have more people invloved and to push the boundaries of what's possible.

On top of the framework, we’re also building the infrastructure to cover the gaps we couldn't cover in the framework:

* A unified dashboard to manage users and user analytics
* Enterprise-grade security: bot, abuse, and fraud protection
* Authentication Email and SMS service
* Fast, globally distributed session storage
* and more.

[Join the waitlist](https://better-auth.build) to get early access to the infrastructure.

And if you're excited about making auth accessible - we're hiring!
