## Better Auth 1.4 Release

We're excited to announce the release of Better Auth 1.4.
This release includes several new features, performance and security improvements.

To upgrade, run:

```package-install
npm install better-auth@1.4
```

---

## 🚀 Highlights

### Stateless Auth

You can now enable stateless session management without any database by omitting the `database` option in your auth config. 

[👉 Read more about stateless auth](/docs/concepts/session-management#stateless-session-management)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    // No database configuration
    socialProviders: {
        google: {
            clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
            clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        },
    },
});
```

It also supports getting `accessToken`, `accountInfo` and `refreshToken` endpoints without any database.

```ts
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const accessToken = await authClient.getAccessToken();

// get account info
const accountInfo = await authClient.accountInfo();
```

---


### SCIM Provisioning

SCIM makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios easier to support via a standardized protocol.

[👉 Read more about SCIM provisioning](/docs/concepts/scim)

```ts
import { scim } from "@better-auth/scim";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [scim()]
});
```
---


### Custom State for OAuth Flows

You can now provide any additional state through the OAuth flow.

[👉 Read more about custom state for OAuth flows](/docs/concepts/oauth#passing-additional-data-through-oauth-flow)

```ts
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "google",
    additionalData: { // [!code highlight]
        referralCode: "ABC123", // [!code highlight]
        source: "landing-page", // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
});
```

Access additional data in any hook, middleware, or endpoints

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { getOAuthState, createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";

const auth = betterAuth({
    hooks: {
      before: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
        const additionalData = await getOAuthState<{ referralCode: string, source: string }>();
        console.log(additionalData);
      })
    }
});
```
---


### Database Joins Improvements (experimental)

Better-Auth now supports database joins, improving over 50 endpoints by 2 to 3x in latency. This is achieved by using database joins under the hood.

To enable, simply set the `joins` flag to `true` under `experimental` in your auth config.
Then, re-run migrations or schema generation to get the updated schema which supports joins!

[👉 Read more about database joins](/docs/concepts/database#experimental-joins)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    experimental: {
        joins: true,
    },
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  Although joins are experimental, they are supported by all adapters and will be enabled by default in the next release.
</Callout>

---

### Secondary Storage Support for API Keys

The API-Key plugin now supports secondary storage for faster key lookups!


[👉 Read more about secondary storage for API keys](/docs/plugins/api-key#secondary-storage)

```ts
import { apiKey } from "@better-auth/api-key";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    secondaryStorage: {
        //...
    },
    plugins: [apiKey({ storage: "secondary-storage" })], // [!code highlight]
});
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="How To Migrate?">
    1. Start with `fallbackToDatabase` enabled and `storage` set to `"secondary-storage"`:

    ```ts
    import { apiKey } from "@better-auth/api-key";
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        secondaryStorage: {
            //...
        },
        plugins: [apiKey({ storage: "secondary-storage", fallbackToDatabase: true })],
    });
    ```

    This allows existing keys in the database to be accessible while new keys are stored in the secondary storage.

    2. **Migrate existing keys** (optional): For faster initial cache population, you can write a migration script
    to copy all keys from the database to the secondary storage. However, this is optional since the cache will warm up automatically as keys are accessed.

    3. **Disable fallback**: Once all keys are migrated or when you're confident the cache is sufficiently populated:

    ```ts
    import { apiKey } from "@better-auth/api-key";
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [
            apiKey({
                storage: "secondary-storage",
                fallbackToDatabase: false // omit, false or undefined // [!code highlight]
            })
        ],
    });
    ```

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### New Default Error Page

We've revamped our error page to look much better and more informative!
You can also customize the stylings of our default error page or simply provide your own path to a custom error page.

[👉 Read more about error page improvements](/docs/reference/options#onapierror)

---

### SSO Domain Verification

Domain verification allows your application to automatically trust a new SSO provider
by automatically validating ownership via the associated domain:

👉 [Read more about domain verification](/docs/plugins/sso#domain-verification)

```ts
import { sso } from "@better-auth/sso";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [sso({ domainVerification: { enabled: true } })],
});
```

---

### CLI Database Index Support

The Better-Auth CLI now supports indexing your database out of the box, which greatly improves the performance of your application.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli generate

npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

---

### JWT Key Rotation Support

The JWT plugin now supports key rotation, allowing you to rotate your JWT keys without downtime.

```ts
import { jwt } from "@better-auth/jwt";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      jwt({ 
        jwks: { rotationInterval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, gracePeriod: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 } // [!code highlight]
      })
    ],
});
```
👉 [Read more about JWT key rotation](/docs/plugins/jwt#key-rotation)

### Improved Generic OAuth Plugin

OAuth providers not yet supported natively will be available as pre-configured options for the generic OAuth plugin,
with plans to eventually support all providers that Auth.js does.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { genericOAuth } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { keycloak } from "better-auth/plugins/generic-oauth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [genericOAuth({
        config: [
            keycloak({
                clientId: process.env.KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID,
                clientSecret: process.env.KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET,
                issuer: process.env.KEYCLOAK_ISSUER,
            })
        ]
    })
    ]
});
```

---

### Bundle Size Optimizations

If you're using custom adapters (like Prisma, Drizzle, or MongoDB),
you can reduce your bundle size by using `better-auth/minimal` instead of better-auth.
This version excludes Kysely, which is only needed when using direct database connections.

[👉 Read more about bundle size optimizations](/docs/guides/optimizing-for-performance#bundle-size-optimization)

```ts
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth/minimal"; // [!code highlight]
import { db } from "./database";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: drizzleAdapter(db, { provider: "pg" }),
});
```

---

### UUID Support

We now support having UUIDs as the primary ID field type out of the box.

[👉 Read more about UUID support](/docs/concepts/database#uuids)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./database";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: db,
    advanced: {
        database: { generateId: "uuid" }, // [!code highlight]
    },
});
```

---

### Improved Email Change Flow

For added security, you can now require users to confirm the change via their **current** email before
the verification email is sent to the new address. 

[👉 Read more about improved email change flow](/docs/concepts/users-accounts#confirming-with-current-email)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        changeEmail: {
            enabled: true,
            sendChangeEmailConfirmation: async ({ user, newEmail, url, token }, request) => {
                await sendEmail({
                    to: user.email, // Sent to the CURRENT email
                    subject: 'Approve email change',
                    text: `Click the link to approve the change to ${newEmail}: ${url}`
                })
            }
        }
    }
});
```

    ```toml title="wrangler.toml"
    compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
    compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"

    Alternatively, if you only need AsyncLocalStorage support:
    ```toml title="wrangler.toml"
    compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_als"]
    ```

    In the next major release, we will assume AsyncLocalStorage support by default, so this configuration will be necessary.
