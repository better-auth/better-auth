## 🚀 Highlights

### Stateless Auth

The long awaited stateless auth is here! Omit the `database` option in your auth config
to enable stateless session management without any database. 

[👉 Read more about stateless auth](/docs/concepts/session-management#stateless-session-management)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    // No database configuration
    socialProviders: {
        google: {
            clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
            clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        },
    },
});
```

### Database Joins

Better-Auth now supports joins, improving over 50 endpoints by 2 to 3x in latency.

To enable, simply set the `joins` flag to `true` under `experimental` in your auth config.
Then, if you use Prisma, Drizzle, or Kysely with `PostgreSQL` / `MySQL` / `MSSQL` / `SQLite`,
re-run migrations or schema generation to get the updated schema which supports joins. 

[👉 Read more about database joins](/docs/concepts/database#experimental-joins)

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    experimental: {
        joins: true,
    },
});
```

---

### Custom State for OAuth Flows

You can now provide any additional state through the OAuth flow.

[👉 Read more about custom state for OAuth flows](/docs/concepts/oauth#passing-additional-data-through-oauth-flow)

```ts
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "google",
    additionalData: {
        referralCode: "ABC123",
        source: "landing-page",
    },
});

```

A lot of refinements to make everything smoother, faster, and more reliable.
