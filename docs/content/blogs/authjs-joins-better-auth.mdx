We’re excited to announce that [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev), formerly known as NextAuth.js, is now being maintained and overseen by Better Auth team. If you haven't heard of Auth.js, it has long been one of the most widely used open source authentication libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Chances are, if you’ve used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Google Labs](https://labs.google), [Cal.com](https://cal.com) or a million other websites, you’ve already interacted with Auth.js.  

## Back Story about Better Auth and Auth.js

Better Auth’s beginnings were inspired by Auth.js. It allowed developers like us to own our auth without spending weeks or months wrestling with OAuth integrations or figuring out session management. But as applications grew more complex and authentication requirements followed the same path, the project’s limited scope became a shortcoming. We found ourselves rebuilding the same primitives again and again, often spending weeks or even months on solutions that still weren’t perfect.
  
The Auth.js team recognized these challenges and had big ideas for the future, but for various reasons couldn’t execute them as fully as they hoped.

The same frustration we all shared led to the creation of Better Auth. Given that we and the Auth.js team align on many of the directions Better Auth is taking, the Auth.js team felt like it was time to move on and focus on other things. 

## What does this mean for existing users?

We recognize how important this project is for countless applications, companies, and developers. If you’re using Auth.js/NextAuth.js today, you can continue doing so without disruption—we’ll keep addressing security patches and urgent issues as they come up.

But we strongly recommend new projects to start with Better Auth unless there are some very specific feature gaps (most notably stateless session management without a database). Our roadmap includes bringing those capabilities into Better Auth, so the ecosystem can converge rather than fragment.

For teams considering migration, we’ve prepared a [guide](/docs/guides/next-auth-migration-guide) and we’ll be adding more guides and documentation soon.

## Final Thoughts

We are deeply grateful to the Auth.js community and core maintainers who have carried the project to this point. In particular, [Balázs](https://x.com/balazsorban44), who served as lead maintainer, pushed through difficult phases, brought in new primitives, and kept the project alive long enough for this transition to even be possible. What we see here is not an ending but a consolidation - a way of ensuring continuity while also accelerating the direction forward.

Better Auth was born out of the limitations of Auth.js, and now, together, the two projects can carry the ecosystem further. The end goal remains unchanged: you should own your auth!
