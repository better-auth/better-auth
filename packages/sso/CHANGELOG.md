# @better-auth/sso

## 1.7.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- [#8836](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/8836) [`93d3871`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/93d3871bd2f7c2fdd423c4c88a22a50b6333e656) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Add `private_key_jwt` (RFC 7523) client authentication across the stack. Servers verify JWT client assertions signed with asymmetric keys; clients sign them for authorization code, refresh, and client credentials flows.

- [#9055](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9055) [`b790144`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/b790144a2e969f1f423c1226147edfb4e69664d1) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - fix(sso)!: harden SAML response validation (InResponseTo, Audience, SessionIndex)

  ### Breaking Changes
  - **`allowIdpInitiated` now defaults to `false`** — IdP-initiated SSO (unsolicited SAML responses) is disabled by default. Set `saml.allowIdpInitiated: true` to restore the previous behavior. This aligns with the SAML2Int interoperability profile which recommends against IdP-initiated SSO due to its susceptibility to injection attacks.

  ### Bug Fixes
  - **InResponseTo validation was completely non-functional** — The code read `extract.inResponseTo` (always `undefined`) instead of samlify's actual path `extract.response.inResponseTo`. SP-initiated InResponseTo validation now works as intended in both ACS handlers.
  - **Audience Restriction was never validated** — SAML assertions issued for a different service provider were accepted without checking the `<AudienceRestriction>` element. Audience is now validated against the configured `samlConfig.audience` value per SAML 2.0 Core §2.5.1.
  - **SessionIndex stored as object instead of string** — samlify returns `sessionIndex` from login responses as `{ authnInstant, sessionNotOnOrAfter, sessionIndex }`, but the code stored the whole object. SLO session-index comparisons always failed silently. The correct inner `sessionIndex` string is now extracted.

  ### Improvements
  - Extracted shared `validateInResponseTo()` and `validateAudience()` into `packages/sso/src/saml/response-validation.ts`, eliminating ~160 lines of duplicated validation logic between the two ACS handlers.
  - Fixed `SAMLAssertionExtract` type to match samlify's actual extractor output shape.

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- [#9097](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9097) [`52c4751`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/52c47517a21600d40a3e82c427409083b4a0a9ec) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - fix(sso): unify SAML response processing and fix provider/config bugs

  **Bug fixes:**
  - Fix SP metadata endpoint using internal row ID instead of `providerId` in ACS URL
  - Fix `acsEndpoint` skipping DB provider lookup when `defaultSSO` is configured
  - Fix `acsEndpoint` missing encryption fields (`isAssertionEncrypted`, `encPrivateKey`), which caused silent decryption failures
  - Fix `defaultSSO` config parsing in callback path (`safeJsonParse` on already-parsed objects)
  - Fix `createSP` missing `callbackUrl` fallback to auto-generated ACS URL
  - Complete `createSP`/`createIdP` helpers with all encryption and signing fields

  **Behavioral changes:**
  - ACS error redirect query parameters now use uppercase error codes (e.g. `error=SAML_MULTIPLE_ASSERTIONS` instead of `error=multiple_assertions`). If your application parses these error codes from the redirect URL, update the expected values.
  - SAML provider registration now rejects configs with no usable IdP entry point (no valid `entryPoint` URL, no `idpMetadata.metadata`, and no `idpMetadata.singleSignOnService`). Previously these would register successfully but fail at sign-in.
  - `entryPoint` validation tightened from `startsWith("http")` to `new URL()` parsing, rejecting malformed URLs like `http:evil` or `http//missing-colon`.

  **Refactoring (no API changes):**
  - Extract shared `processSAMLResponse` pipeline to eliminate ~500 lines of duplicated logic between `callbackSSOSAML` and `acsEndpoint`
  - Move `validateSAMLTimestamp` to `saml/timestamp.ts` (re-exported from original location for compatibility)

  Some SAML IDPs send SAMLResponse with line-wrapped base64 (per RFC 2045), which caused decoding failures. Whitespace is now stripped at the request boundary before any processing.
