# @better-auth/core

## 1.7.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- [#9305](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9305) [`e7eb45b`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/e7eb45b065903f5fccddae491696cb069814a3c8) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - feat(oauth): per-request `additionalParams` and `loginHint` parity across `signIn.social`, `linkSocial`, and `signIn.sso`

  Unified escape hatch for customizing the provider authorization URL on a per-request basis. Previously, dynamic parameters like Google's `access_type=offline` / `prompt=consent`, Cognito's `identity_provider=Google`, or Microsoft's `domain_hint` could only be set as static server configuration.

  ### New capabilities
  - `signIn.social`, `linkSocial`, and `signIn.sso` accept `additionalParams: Record<string, string>`. Values are appended to the authorization URL as query parameters.
  - `linkSocial` also accepts `loginHint`, matching the surface of `signIn.social` and `signIn.sso`.
  - `OAuthProvider.createAuthorizationURL` gains `additionalParams` in its input contract; every built-in provider forwards it to the shared helper.
  - Generic-OAuth providers merge call-time `additionalParams` with the config-level `authorizationUrlParams`; call-time wins on key collision.
  - Cognito exposes a typed `identityProvider?: string` config option that maps to the `identity_provider` query parameter, avoiding magic strings.

  ### Security
  - The shared `createAuthorizationURL` helper silently drops any caller-supplied key in `RESERVED_AUTHORIZATION_PARAMS` (`state`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `response_type`, `code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method`, `scope`). The request-body Zod schema rejects the same keys with 400, so misuse is visible at the edge rather than silently overriding security-critical parameters.
  - Providers that use non-standard client identifiers (`wechat` → `appid`, `tiktok` → `client_key`) additionally filter those keys so a caller cannot swap the configured OAuth app.
  - Provider protocol constants that are required for the integration to function (`atlassian` → `audience`, `notion` → `owner`) are merged last so caller-supplied `additionalParams` cannot override them. Configured defaults that represent operator intent (e.g. Google `include_granted_scopes`, Cognito `identityProvider`) remain caller-overridable.
  - `signIn.sso` rejects `additionalParams` with 400 when the resolved provider is SAML; the SAML AuthnRequest is signed and cannot carry caller-supplied query parameters, so silently dropping them would mislead integrators.

  ### OpenAPI
  - Added `ZodRecord` handling to the OpenAPI generator so `z.record()` fields emit `type: object` with typed `additionalProperties`. Incidentally fixes a long-standing bug where `additionalData` was rendered as `type: string`.

  ### Refactors
  - `discord`, `roblox`, `zoom`, and `slack` providers now delegate to the shared `createAuthorizationURL` helper and inherit its RFC behavior and reserved-key guard.
  - `tiktok` and `wechat` keep their manual URL construction (non-standard OAuth2 parameter names and URL fragment requirements) but thread `additionalParams` with the same reserved-key filter.

- [#9657](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9657) [`1e5b808`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/1e5b80847208cf839c9d45363ca19b8eab41c68a) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Harden `private_key_jwt` and token endpoint client authentication, and add the helpers that make the fix structural.

  `@better-auth/core/oauth2` now exposes `encodeBasicCredentials` and `decodeBasicCredentials`, a round-trip-tested pair that follows RFC 6749 §2.3.1 (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` each value, split on the first `:` only). The decoder accepts the scheme case-insensitively and tolerates one or more spaces before the credentials per RFC 7235 §2.1. `client_secret_basic` on the client side and the Better Auth OAuth provider on the server side both go through these helpers, so credentials containing reserved characters round-trip cleanly across the stack and headers like `basic xxx` or `Basic  xxx` are accepted.

  `createPrivateKeyJwtClientAssertionGetter` validates options eagerly. Unsupported algorithms (`HS256`, `none`), a JWK with no key material, and disagreement between an explicit `algorithm` and the JWK-embedded `alg` all throw at construction rather than on the first token request. `signPrivateKeyJwtClientAssertion` enforces the same checks for direct callers. **Breaking:** configurations that paired an unsupported JWK `alg` with a different explicit `algorithm` used to silently sign with the explicit option; they now fail at construction.

  `@better-auth/oauth-provider` rejects empty `jwks` payloads at the schema layer (`jwks: []` and `jwks: { keys: [] }`) so the documented client metadata contract matches what `checkOAuthClient` already enforces at runtime. Schema consumers (TypeScript, OpenAPI, generated SDKs) now see the constraint.

  The SSO `private_key_jwt` flow redirects with `error_description=no_private_key_available` when a `resolvePrivateKey` callback returns no `privateKeyJwk` or `privateKeyPem`. The redirect path previously short-circuited only when the resolver was absent entirely; an empty resolver return fell through into an internal signing error.

  `better-auth/test` adds `getHttpTestInstance`, a counterpart to `getTestInstance` that binds a real HTTP listener on an OS-assigned port and constructs the auth instance against the discovered URL. It removes the temp-server-then-rebind race that test files have been individually copy-pasting.

### Patch Changes

- [#9301](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9301) [`03e6c94`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/03e6c94e965a7e87c1d44074b8e90257cb1f1cd2) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Add `allowIdpInitiated` to `GenericOAuthConfig` and SSO `OIDCConfig` to support providers that initiate OAuth without a `state` parameter (e.g. Clever). When enabled, stateless callbacks restart the OAuth flow server-side with fresh state and PKCE, preserving CSRF protection. Also hardens `parseState` against undefined request bodies on GET callbacks.

- [#9845](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9845) [`13abc79`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/13abc7922b47f800da59ca212d364a64feeec91f) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Harden redirect-URI validation across the OAuth provider plugins. `isSafeUrlScheme` and `SafeUrlSchema` no longer call `URL.canParse`, which is absent on some supported runtimes and could throw or silently disable the dangerous-scheme check. They now parse with a `try`/`catch` fallback. `SafeUrlSchema` also rejects redirect URIs that contain a fragment component, per RFC 6749 §3.1.2.

## 1.6.8

### Patch Changes

- [#9331](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9331) [`9aa8e63`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/9aa8e63de84549634216e13e407cf6d8aa61acc3) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - fix(oauth): support `mapProfileToUser` fallback for providers that may omit email

  Social sign-in with OAuth providers that may return no email address (Discord phone-only accounts, Apple subsequent sign-ins, GitHub private emails, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Microsoft Entra ID managed users) can now be unblocked by synthesizing an email inside `mapProfileToUser`. Rejection logger messages now point at this workaround and at the new ["Handling Providers Without Email"](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/oauth#handling-providers-without-email) docs section.

  Provider profile types now reflect where `email` can be `null` or absent:
  - `DiscordProfile.email` is `string | null` and optional (absent when the `email` scope is not granted)
  - `AppleProfile.email` is optional
  - `GithubProfile.email` is `string | null`
  - `FacebookProfile.email` is optional
  - `FacebookProfile.email_verified` is optional (Meta's Graph API does not include this field)
  - `LinkedInProfile.email` is optional
  - `LinkedInProfile.email_verified` is optional
  - `MicrosoftEntraIDProfile.email` is optional

  TypeScript consumers who previously dereferenced `profile.email` directly inside `mapProfileToUser` will see a compile error that matches the runtime reality; use a nullish-coalescing fallback (`profile.email ?? ...`) or null-check the field.

  Sign-in still rejects with `error=email_not_found` (social callback) or `error=email_is_missing` (Generic OAuth plugin) when neither the provider nor `mapProfileToUser` produces an email. First-class support for users without an email, keyed on `(providerId, accountId)` per OpenID Connect Core §5.7, is tracked in [#9124](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues/9124).

## 1.6.7

### Patch Changes

- [#9211](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9211) [`307196a`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/307196a405e067f4a863de2ed68528e8d4bdc162) Thanks [@stewartjarod](https://github.com/stewartjarod)! - Preserve `Set-Cookie` headers accumulated on `ctx.responseHeaders` when an endpoint throws `APIError`. Cookie side-effects from `deleteSessionCookie` (and any `ctx.setCookie` / `ctx.setHeader` calls before the throw) are no longer silently discarded on the error path.

- [#9281](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9281) [`4a180f0`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/4a180f0b0c084c59e7b006058d3fdbd8542face5) Thanks [@ramonclaudio](https://github.com/ramonclaudio)! - fix(core): serve noop `./instrumentation` on `browser`/`edge` conditions, matching `./async_hooks`

- [#9292](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9292) [`4f373ee`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/4f373eed8a42e02460dbd2ee9973b9493cea04eb) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Accept an array of Client IDs on providers that verify ID tokens by audience (Google, Apple, Microsoft Entra, Facebook, Cognito). The first entry is used for the authorization code flow; all entries are accepted when verifying an ID token's `aud` claim, so a single backend can serve Web, iOS, and Android clients with their platform-specific Client IDs.

  ```ts
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: [
        process.env.GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID!,
        process.env.GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID!,
        process.env.GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID!,
      ],
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    },
  }
  ```

  Passing a single string keeps working; no migration needed.

  Also exports `getPrimaryClientId` from `@better-auth/core/oauth2` for provider authors: it returns the primary Client ID (the raw string, or the entry at array index 0), paired with `clientSecret` for the authorization code flow. Providers now reject empty arrays, empty strings, and missing config at sign-in time instead of silently producing a malformed authorization URL. Google, Apple, and Facebook require both `clientId` and `clientSecret` because each of those providers mandates a client secret for their server-side code exchange. Microsoft Entra and Cognito only require `clientId`, since both support public-client flows with PKCE alone (no secret).

- [#9227](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9227) [`b5742f9`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/b5742f9d08d7c6ae0848279b79c8bcc0a09082d7) Thanks [@bytaesu](https://github.com/bytaesu)! - feat(core): add `mapConcurrent` bounded-concurrency utility at `@better-auth/core/utils/async`

- [#9226](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/9226) [`e64ff72`](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/e64ff720fb8514cb78aedd1660223d8b948284da) Thanks [@gustavovalverde](https://github.com/gustavovalverde)! - Consolidate host/IP classification behind `@better-auth/core/utils/host` and close several loopback/SSRF bypasses that the previous per-package regex checks missed.

  **Electron user-image proxy: SSRF bypasses closed (`@better-auth/electron`).** `fetchUserImage` previously gated outbound requests with a bespoke IPv4/IPv6 regex that missed multiple vectors. All of the following were reachable in production and are now blocked:
  - `http://tenant.localhost/` and other `*.localhost` names (RFC 6761 reserves the entire TLD for loopback).
  - `http://[::ffff:169.254.169.254]/` (IPv4-mapped IPv6 to AWS IMDS, the classic SSRF bypass).
  - `http://metadata.google.internal/`, `http://metadata.goog/` (GCP instance metadata).
  - `http://instance-data/`, `http://instance-data.ec2.internal/` (AWS IMDS alternate FQDNs).
  - `http://100.100.100.200/` (Alibaba Cloud IMDS; lives in RFC 6598 shared address space `100.64/10`, which the old regex did not cover).
  - `http://0.0.0.0:PORT/` (the Linux/macOS kernel routes the unspecified address to loopback: Oligo's "0.0.0.0 Day").
  - `http://[fc00::...]/`, `http://[fd00::...]/` (IPv6 ULA per RFC 4193) and IPv6 link-local `fe80::/10`, neither of which the regex recognized.

  Documentation ranges (RFC 5737 / RFC 3849), benchmarking (`198.18/15`), multicast, and broadcast are also now rejected.

  **`better-auth`: `0.0.0.0` is no longer treated as loopback.** The previous `isLoopbackHost` implementation in `packages/better-auth/src/utils/url.ts` classified `0.0.0.0` alongside `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost`. `0.0.0.0` is the unspecified address, not loopback; treating it as such lets browser-origin requests reach localhost-bound dev services (Oligo's "0.0.0.0 Day"). The helper now accepts the full `127.0.0.0/8` range and any `*.localhost` name, and rejects `0.0.0.0`.

  **`better-auth`: trusted-origin substring hardening.** `getTrustedOrigins` previously used `host.includes("localhost") || host.includes("127.0.0.1")` when deciding whether to add an `http://` variant for a dynamic `baseURL.allowedHosts` entry. Misconfigurations like `evil-localhost.com` or `127.0.0.1.nip.io` would incorrectly gain an HTTP origin in the trust list. The check now uses the shared classifier, so only real loopback hosts get the HTTP variant.

  **`@better-auth/oauth-provider`: RFC 8252 compliance.**
  - §7.3 redirect URI matching now accepts the full `127.0.0.0/8` range (not just `127.0.0.1`) plus `[::1]`, with port-flexible comparison. Port-flexible matching is limited to IP literals; DNS names such as `localhost` continue to use exact-string matching per §8.3 ("NOT RECOMMENDED" for loopback).
  - `validateIssuerUrl` uses the shared loopback check rather than a two-hostname literal comparison.

  **New module: `@better-auth/core/utils/host`.** Exposes `classifyHost`, `isLoopbackIP`, `isLoopbackHost`, and `isPublicRoutableHost`. One RFC 6890 / RFC 6761 / RFC 8252 implementation that handles IPv4, IPv6 (including bracketed literals, zone IDs, IPv4-mapped addresses, and 6to4 / NAT64 / Teredo tunnel forms with embedded-IPv4 recursion), and FQDNs, with a curated cloud-metadata FQDN set. All bespoke loopback/private/link-local checks across the monorepo now route through it.
