## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

## Getting Started

pnpm install better-auth
